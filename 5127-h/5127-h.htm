vii</span>PREFACE</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is with some hesitation that I
give my husband&rsquo;s last book to the world.&nbsp; It was in
type when he died, but he had no time to correct even the first
proofs, and doubtless he would have made many changes, if not in
his views at least in his expression of them.&nbsp; Mr. Bartram
has verified the quotations and dates with infinite care, and for
this he has my warmest thanks.&nbsp; For the rest I can but ask
those who differ from the author to remember the circumstances in
which the work has been published.</p>

xiii</span>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> theory that Francis Bacon was,
in the main, the author of &ldquo;Shakespeare&rsquo;s
plays,&rdquo; has now been for fifty years before the learned
world.&nbsp; Its advocates have met with less support than they
had reason to expect.&nbsp; Their methods, their logic, and their
hypotheses closely resemble those applied by many British and
foreign scholars to Homer; and by critics of the very Highest
School to Holy Writ.&nbsp; Yet the Baconian theory is universally
rejected in England by the professors and historians of English
literature; and generally by students who have no profession save
that of Letters.&nbsp; The Baconians, however, do not lack the
countenance and assistance of highly distinguished persons, whose
names are famous where those of mere men of letters are unknown;
and in circles where the title of &ldquo;Professor&rdquo; is not
duly respected.</p>
<p>The partisans of Bacon aver (or one of them avers) that
&ldquo;Lord Penzance, Lord Beaconsfield, Lord Palmerston, Judge
Webb, Judge Holmes (of Kentucky, U.S.), Prince Bismarck, John
Bright, and innumerable most <i>thoughtful scholars eminent in
many walks of life</i>, <i>and especially in </i><a
name="pagexiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xiv</span><i>the
legal profession</i> . . . &rdquo; have been Baconians, or, at
least, opposed to Will Shakspere&rsquo;s authorship.&nbsp; To
these names of scholars I must add that of my late friend, Samuel
Clemens, D.Litt. of Oxford; better known to many as Mark
Twain.&nbsp; Dr. Clemens was, indeed, no mean literary critic;
witness his epoch-making study of Prof. Dowden&rsquo;s <i>Life of
Shelley</i>, while his researches into the biography of Jeanne
d&rsquo;Arc were most conscientious.</p>
<p>With the deepest respect for the political wisdom and literary
taste of Lord Palmerston, Prince Bismarck, Lord Beaconsfield, and
the late Mr. John Bright; and with every desire to humble myself
before the judicial verdicts of Judges Holmes, Webb, and Lord
Penzance; with sincere admiration of my late friend, Dr. Clemens,
I cannot regard them as, in the first place and professionally,
trained students of literary history.</p>
<p>They were no more specially trained students of Elizabethan
literature than myself; they were amateurs in this province, as I
am an amateur, who differ from all of them in opinion.&nbsp;
Difference of opinion concerning points of literary history ought
not to make &ldquo;our angry passions rise.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet this
controversy has been extremely bitter.</p>
<p>I abstain from quoting the &ldquo;sweetmeats,&rdquo; in
Captain MacTurk&rsquo;s phrase, which have been exchanged by the
combatants.&nbsp; Charges of ignorance and monomania have been
answered <a name="pagexv"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xv</span>by charges of forgery, lying, &ldquo;scandalous literary
dishonesty,&rdquo; and even inaccuracy.&nbsp; Now no mortal is
infallibly accurate, but we are all sane and &ldquo;indifferent
honest.&rdquo;&nbsp; There have been forgeries in matters
Shakespearean, alas, but not in connection with the Baconian
controversy.</p>
<p>It is an argument of the Baconians, and generally of the
impugners of good Will&rsquo;s authorship of the plays vulgarly
attributed to him, that the advocates of William Shakspere, Gent,
as author of the plays, differ like the Kilkenny cats among
themselves on many points.&nbsp; All do not believe, with Mr. J.
C. Collins, that Will knew Sophocles, Euripides, and
&AElig;schylus (but not Aristophanes) as well as Mr. Swinburne
did, or knew them at all&mdash;for that matter.&nbsp; Mr. Pollard
differs very widely from Sir Sidney Lee on points concerning the
First Folio and the Quartos: my sympathies are with Mr.
Pollard.&nbsp; Few, if any, partisans of Will agree with Mrs.
Stopes (herself no Baconian) about the history of the Stratford
monument of the poet.&nbsp; About Will&rsquo;s authorship of
<i>Titus Andronicus</i>, and <i>Henry VI</i>, Part I, the friends
of Will, like the friends of Bacon, are at odds among
themselves.&nbsp; These and other divergencies of opinion cause
the Baconians to laugh, as if <i>they</i> were a harmonious
circle . . . !&nbsp; For the Baconian camp is not less divided
against itself than the camp of the
&ldquo;Stratfordians.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not all Baconians hold that
Bacon was the legitimate son of &ldquo;that Imperial <a
name="pagexvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xvi</span>votaress&rdquo; Queen Elizabeth.&nbsp; Not all believe
in the Cryptogram of Mr. Ignatius Donnelly, or in any other
cryptograms.&nbsp; Not all maintain that Bacon, in the Sonnets,
was inspired by a passion for the Earl of Essex, for Queen
Elizabeth, or for an early miniature of himself.&nbsp; Not all
regard him as the author of the plays of Kit Marlowe.&nbsp; Not
all suppose him to be a Rosicrucian, who possibly died at the age
of a hundred and six, or, perhaps, may be &ldquo;still
running.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not all aver that he wrote thirteen plays
before 1593.&nbsp; But one party holds that, in the main, Will
was the author of the plays, while the other party votes for
Bacon&mdash;or for Bungay, a Great Unknown.&nbsp; I use Bungay as
an endearing term for the mysterious being who was the Author if
Francis Bacon was not.&nbsp; Friar Bungay was the rival of Friar
Bacon, as the Unknown (if he was not Francis Bacon) is the rival
of &ldquo;the inventor of Inductive reasoning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could never have expected that I should take a part in this
controversy; but acquaintance with <i>The Shakespeare Problem
Restated</i> (503 pp.), (1908), and later works of Mr. G. G.
Greenwood, M.P., has tempted me to enter the lists.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood is worth fighting; he is cunning of fence, is
learned (and I cannot conceal my opinion that Mr. Donnelly and
Judge Holmes were rather ignorant).&nbsp; He is not over
&ldquo;the threshold of Eld&rdquo; (as were Judge Webb and Lord
Penzance when they took up Shakespearean criticism).&nbsp; <a
name="pagexvii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xvii</span>His
knowledge of Elizabethan literature is vastly superior to mine,
for I speak merely, in Matthew Arnold&rsquo;s words, as &ldquo;a
belletristic trifler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moreover, Mr. Greenwood, as a practising barrister, is a judge
of legal evidence; and, being a man of sense, does not
&ldquo;hold a brief for Bacon&rdquo; as the author of the
Shakespearean plays and poems, and does not value Baconian
cryptograms.&nbsp; In the following chapters I make endeavours,
conscientious if fallible, to state the theory of Mr.
Greenwood.&nbsp; It is a negative theory.&nbsp; He denies that
Will Shakspere (or Shaxbere, or Shagspur, and so on) was the
author of the plays and poems.&nbsp; Some other party was, <i>in
the main</i>, with other hands, the author.&nbsp; Mr. Greenwood
cannot, or does not, offer a guess as to who this ingenious
Somebody was.&nbsp; He does not affirm, and he does not deny,
that Bacon had a share, greater or less, in the undertaking.</p>
<p>In my brief tractate I have not room to consider every
argument; to traverse every field.&nbsp; In philology I am all
unlearned, and cannot pretend to discuss the language of
Shakespeare, any more than I can analyse the language of Homer
into proto-Arcadian and Cyprian, and so on.&nbsp; Again, I cannot
pretend to have an opinion, based on internal evidence, about the
genuine Shakespearean character of such plays as <i>Titus
Andronicus</i>, <i>Henry VI</i>, Part I, and <i>Troilus and
Cressida</i>.&nbsp; About them different views are held
<i>within</i> both camps.</p>
<p><a name="pagexviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xviii</span>I
am no lawyer or naturalist (as Partridge said, <i>Non omnia
possumus omnes</i>), and cannot imagine why our Author is so
accurate in his frequent use of terms of law&mdash;if he be Will;
and so totally at sea in natural history&mdash;if he be Francis,
who &ldquo;took all knowledge for his province.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How can a layman pretend to deal with Shakespeare&rsquo;s
legal attainments, after he has read the work of the learned
Recorder of Bristol, Mr. Castle, K.C.?&nbsp; To his legal mind it
seems that in some of Will&rsquo;s plays he had the aid of an
expert in law, and then his technicalities were correct.&nbsp; In
other plays he had no such tutor, and then he was sadly to seek
in his legal jargon.&nbsp; I understand Mr. Greenwood to disagree
on this point.&nbsp; Mr. Castle says, &ldquo;I think Shakespeare
would have had no difficulty in getting aid from several
sources.&nbsp; There is therefore no <i>prima facie</i> reason
why we should suppose the information was supplied by
Bacon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course there is not!</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact, there are some reasons why one should
attribute the legal assistance, say, to Coke, rather than to
Bacon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The truth is, that Bacon seems not to have been lawyer enough
for Will&rsquo;s purposes.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have no reason to
believe that Bacon was particularly well read in the
technicalities of our law; he never seems to have seriously
followed his profession.&rdquo; <a name="citation0a"></a><a
href="#footnote0a" class="citation">[0a]</a></p>
<p><a name="pagexix"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xix</span>Now
we have Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s testimonial in favour of Mr.
Castle, &ldquo;Who really does know something about law.&rdquo;
<a name="citation0b"></a><a href="#footnote0b"
class="citation">[0b]</a>&nbsp; Mr. Castle thinks that Bacon
really did not know enough about law, and suggests Sir Edward
Coke, of all human beings, as conceivably Will&rsquo;s
&ldquo;coach&rdquo; on legal technicalities.&nbsp; Perhaps Will
consulted the Archbishop of Canterbury on theological
niceties?</p>
<p><i>Que s&ccedil;ais je</i>?&nbsp; In some plays, says Mr.
Castle, Will&rsquo;s law is all right, in other plays it is all
wrong.&nbsp; As to Will&rsquo;s law, when Mr. Greenwood and Mr.
Castle differ, a layman dare not intervene.</p>
<p>Concerning legend and tradition about our Will, it seems that,
in each case, we should do our best to trace the <i>Quellen</i>,
to discover the original sources, and the steps by which the tale
arrived at its late recorders in print; and then each man&rsquo;s
view as to the veracity of the story will rest on his sense of
probability; and on his bias, his wish to believe or to
disbelieve.</p>
<p>There exists, I believe, only one personal anecdote of Will,
the actor, and on it the Baconians base an argument against the
contemporary recognition of him as a dramatic author.&nbsp; I
take the criticism of Mr. Greenwood (who is not a
Baconian).&nbsp; One John Manningham, Barrister-at-Law, &ldquo;a
well-educated and cultured man,&rdquo; notes in his Diary
(February 2, 1601) that &ldquo;at our feast we had a play called
Twelve Night or What you Will, much like the Comedy of Errors, or
Men&aelig;chmi <a name="pagexx"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xx</span>in Plautus, but most like and near to that in Italian
called <i>Inganni</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; He confides to his Diary the
tricks played on Malvolio as &ldquo;a good practice.&rdquo; <a
name="citation0c"></a><a href="#footnote0c"
class="citation">[0c]</a>&nbsp; That is all.</p>
<p>About the authorship he says nothing: perhaps he neither knew
nor cared who the author was.&nbsp; In our day the majority of
people who tell me about a play which they have seen, cannot tell
me the name of the author.&nbsp; Yet it is usually printed on the
playbill, though in modest type.&nbsp; The public does not care a
straw about the author&rsquo;s name, unless he be deservedly
famous for writing letters to the newspapers on things in
general; for his genius as an orator; his enthusiasm as a
moralist, or in any other extraneous way.&nbsp; Dr. Forman in his
queer account of the plot of &ldquo;Mack Beth&rdquo; does not
allude to the name of the author (April 20, 1610).&nbsp;
<i>Twelfth Night</i> was not published till 1623, in the Folio:
there was no quarto to enlighten Manningham about the
author&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; We do not hear of printed playbills,
with author&rsquo;s names inserted, at that period.&nbsp; It
seems probable that occasional playgoers knew and cared no more
about authors than they do at present.&nbsp; The world of the
wits, the critics (such as Francis Meres), poets, playwrights,
and players, did know and care about the authors; apparently
Manningham did not.&nbsp; But he heard a piquant anecdote of two
players and (March 13, 1601) inserted it in his Diary.</p>
<p><a name="pagexxi"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxi</span>Shakespeare once anticipated Richard Burbage at an
amorous tryst with a citizen&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; Burbage had, by
the way, been playing the part of Richard III.&nbsp; While Will
was engaged in illicit dalliance, the message was brought (what a
moment for bringing messages!) that Richard III was at the door,
and Will &ldquo;caused return to be made that William the
Conqueror was before Richard III.&nbsp; <i>Shakespeare&rsquo;s
name William</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; (My italics.)&nbsp; Mr. Greenwood
argues that if &ldquo;Shakspere the player was known to the world
as the author of the plays of Shakespeare, it does seem extremely
remarkable&rdquo; that Manningham should have thought it needful
to add &ldquo;Shakespeare&rsquo;s name William.&rdquo; <a
name="citation0d"></a><a href="#footnote0d"
class="citation">[0d]</a></p>
<p>But <i>was</i> &ldquo;Shakspere,&rdquo; or any man,
&ldquo;known to the world as the author of the plays of
Shakespeare&rdquo;?&nbsp; No! for Mr. Greenwood writes,
&ldquo;nobody, outside a very small circle, troubled his head as
to who the dramatist or dramatists might be.&rdquo; <a
name="citation0e"></a><a href="#footnote0e"
class="citation">[0e]</a>&nbsp; To that &ldquo;very small
circle&rdquo; we have no reason to suppose that Manningham
belonged, despite his remarkable opinion that <i>Twelfth
Night</i> resembles the <i>Men&aelig;chmi</i>.&nbsp;
Consequently, it is <i>not</i> &ldquo;extremely remarkable&rdquo;
that Manningham wrote &ldquo;Shakespeare&rsquo;s name
William,&rdquo; to explain to posterity the joke about
&ldquo;William the Conqueror,&rdquo; instead of saying,
&ldquo;the brilliant author of the Twelfth Night play which so
much amused me at <a name="pagexxii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
xxii</span>our feast a few weeks ago.&rdquo; <a
name="citation0f"></a><a href="#footnote0f"
class="citation">[0f]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Remarkable&rdquo; out of
all hooping it would have been had Manningham written in the
style of Mr. Greenwood.&nbsp; But Manningham apparently did not
&ldquo;trouble his head as to who the dramatist or dramatists
might be.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Nobody, outside a very small
circle,&rdquo; <i>did</i> trouble his poor head about that
point.&nbsp; Yet Mr. Greenwood thinks &ldquo;it does seem
extremely remarkable&rdquo; that Manningham did not mention the
author.</p>
<p>Later, on the publication of the Folio (1623), the world seems
to have taken more interest in literary matters.&nbsp; Mr.
Greenwood says that then while &ldquo;the multitude&rdquo; would
take Ben Jonson&rsquo;s noble panegyric on Shakespeare as a poet
&ldquo;<i>au pied de la lettre</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;the enlightened
few would recognise that it had an esoteric meaning.&rdquo; <a
name="citation0g"></a><a href="#footnote0g"
class="citation">[0g]</a>&nbsp; Then, it seems, &ldquo;the
world&rdquo;&mdash;the &ldquo;multitude&rdquo;&mdash;regarded the
actor as the author.&nbsp; Only &ldquo;the enlightened few&rdquo;
were aware that when Ben <i>said</i> &ldquo;Shakespeare,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Swan of Avon,&rdquo; he <i>meant</i>&mdash;somebody
else.</p>
<p>Quite different inferences are drawn from the same facts by
persons of different mental conditions.&nbsp; For example, in
1635 or 1636, Cuthbert Burbage, brother of Richard, the famous
actor, Will&rsquo;s comrade, petitioned Lord Pembroke, then Lord
Chamberlain, for consideration in a quarrel about certain
theatres.&nbsp; Telling the history of <a
name="pagexxiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxiii</span>the
houses, he mentions that the Burbages &ldquo;to ourselves joined
those deserving men, Shakspere, Heminge, Condell, Phillips and
others.&rdquo;&nbsp; Cuthbert is arguing his case solely from the
point of the original owners or lease-holders of the houses, and
of the well-known actors to whom they joined themselves.&nbsp;
Judge Webb and Mr. Greenwood think that &ldquo;it does indeed
seem strange . . . that the proprietor[s] of the playhouses which
had been made famous by the production of the Shakespearean
plays, should, in 1635&mdash;twelve years after the publication
of the great Folio&mdash;describe their reputed author to the
survivor of the Incomparable Pair, as merely a
&lsquo;man-player&rsquo; and &lsquo;a deserving
man.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Why did he not remind the Lord
Chamberlain that this &ldquo;deserving man&rdquo; was the author
of all these famous dramas?&nbsp; Was it because he was aware
that the Earl of Pembroke &ldquo;knew better than that&rdquo;? <a
name="citation0h"></a><a href="#footnote0h"
class="citation">[0h]</a></p>
<p>These arguments are regarded by some Baconians as proof
positive of their case.</p>
<p>Cuthbert Burbage, in 1635 or 1636, did not remind the Earl of
what the Earl knew very well, that the Folio had been dedicated,
in 1623, to him and his brother, by Will&rsquo;s friends, Heminge
and Condell, as they had been patrons of the late William
Shakspere and admirers of his plays.&nbsp; The terms of this
dedication are to be cited in the text, later.&nbsp; <i>We</i>
all <i>now</i> would have reminded the Earl of what he very well
knew.&nbsp; Cuthbert did not.</p>
<p><a name="pagexxiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxiv</span>The
intelligence of Cuthbert Burbage may be gauged by anyone who will
read pp. 481&ndash;484 in <i>William Shakespeare</i>, <i>His
Family and Friends</i>, by the late Mr. Charles Elton, Q.C., of
White Staunton.&nbsp; Cuthbert was a puzzle-pated old boy.&nbsp;
The silence as to Will&rsquo;s authorship on the part of this
muddle-headed old Cuthbert, in 1635&ndash;36, cannot outweigh the
explicit and positive public testimony to his authorship, signed
by his friends and fellow-actors in 1623.</p>
<p>Men believe what they may; but I prefer positive evidence for
the affirmative to negative evidence from silence, the silence of
Cuthbert Burbage.</p>
<p>One may read through Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s three books and
note the engaging varieties of his views; they vary as suits his
argument; but he is unaware of it, or can justify his
varyings.&nbsp; Thus, in 1610, one John Davies wrote rhymes in
which he speaks of &ldquo;our English Terence, Mr. Will
Shakespeare&rdquo;; &ldquo;good Will.&rdquo;&nbsp; In his period
patriotic English critics called a comic dramatist &ldquo;the
English Terence,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the English Plautus,&rdquo;
precisely as American critics used to call Mr. Bryant &ldquo;the
American Wordsworth,&rdquo; or Cooper &ldquo;the American
Scott&rdquo;; and as Scots called the Rev. Mr. Thomson &ldquo;the
Scottish Turner.&rdquo;&nbsp; Somewhere, I believe, exists
&ldquo;the Belgian Shakespeare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Following this practice, Davies had to call Will either
&ldquo;our English Terence,&rdquo; or &ldquo;our <a
name="pagexxv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxv</span>English
Plautus.&rdquo;&nbsp; Aristophanes would not have been generally
recognised; and Will was no more like one of these ancient
authors than another.&nbsp; Thus Davies was apt to choose either
Plautus or Terence; it was even betting which he selected.&nbsp;
But he chanced to choose Terence; and this is
&ldquo;curious,&rdquo; and suggests suspicions to Mr.
Greenwood&mdash;and the Baconians.&nbsp; They are so very full of
suspicions!</p>
<p>It does not suit the Baconians, or Mr. Greenwood, to find
contemporary recognition of Will as an author. <a
name="citation0i"></a><a href="#footnote0i"
class="citation">[0i]</a>&nbsp; Consequently, Mr. Greenwood finds
Davies&rsquo;s &ldquo;curious, and at first sight, inappropriate
comparison of &lsquo;Shake-speare&rsquo; to Terence worthy of
remark, for Terence is the very author whose name is alleged to
have been used as a mask-name, or <i>nom de plume</i>, for the
writings of great men who wished to keep the fact of their
authorship concealed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Davies felt bound to bring in <i>some</i> Roman parallel
to Shakespeare; and had only the choice of Terence or
Plautus.&nbsp; Meres (1598) used Plautus; Davies used
Terence.&nbsp; Mr. Greenwood <a name="citation0j"></a><a
href="#footnote0j" class="citation">[0j]</a> shows us that
Plautus would not do.&nbsp; &ldquo;Could <i>he</i>&rdquo;
(Shakespeare) &ldquo;write only of courtesans and
<i>cocottes</i>, and not of ladies highly born, cultured, and
refined? . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The supposed parallel&rdquo; (Plautus and Shakespeare)
&ldquo;breaks down at every point.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus, <a
name="pagexxvi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xxvi</span>on Mr.
Greenwood&rsquo;s showing, Plautus could not serve Davies, or
should not serve him, in his search for a Roman parallel to
&ldquo;good Will.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Mr. Greenwood also writes,
&ldquo;if he&rdquo; (Shakespeare) &ldquo;was to be likened to a
Latin comedian, surely Plautus is the writer with whom he should
have been compared.&rdquo; <a name="citation0k"></a><a
href="#footnote0k" class="citation">[0k]</a>&nbsp; Yet Plautus
was the very man who cannot be used as a parallel to
Shakespeare.&nbsp; Of course no Roman nor any other comic
dramatist closely resembles the <i>author</i> of <i>As You Like
It</i>.&nbsp; They who selected either Plautus or Terence meant
no more than that both were celebrated comic dramatists.&nbsp;
Plautus was no parallel to Will.&nbsp; Yet &ldquo;surely Plautus
is the author to whom he should have been compared&rdquo; by
Davies, says Mr. Greenwood.&nbsp; If Davies tried Plautus, the
comparison was bad; if Terence, it was &ldquo;curious,&rdquo; as
Terence was absurdly accused of being the &ldquo;<i>nom de
plume</i>&rdquo; of some great &ldquo;concealed poets&rdquo; of
Rome.&nbsp; &ldquo;From all the known facts about Terence,&rdquo;
says a Baconian critic (who has consulted Smith&rsquo;s
<i>Biographical Dictionary</i>), &ldquo;it is an almost
unavoidable inference that John Davies made the comparison to
Shakspere because he knew of the point common to both
cases.&rdquo;&nbsp; The common point is taken to be, not that
both men were famous comic dramatists, but that Roman literary
gossips said, and that Baconians and Mr. Greenwood say, that
&ldquo;Terence&rdquo; was said to be a &ldquo;mask-name,&rdquo;
and that &ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo; <a name="pagexxvii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxvii</span>is a mask-name.&nbsp; Of the
second opinion there is not a hint in literature of the time of
good Will.</p>
<p>What surprises one most in this controversy is that men
eminent in the legal profession should be
&ldquo;anti-Shakesperean,&rdquo; if not overtly Baconian.&nbsp;
For the evidence for the contemporary faith in Will&rsquo;s
authorship is all positive; from his own age comes not a whisper
of doubt, not even a murmur of surprise.&nbsp; It is incredible
to me that his fellow-actors and fellow-playwrights should have
been deceived, especially when they were such men as Ben Jonson
and Tom Heywood.&nbsp; One would expect lawyers, of all people,
to have been most impatient of the surprising attempts made to
explain away Ben Jonson&rsquo;s testimony, by aid, first, of
quite a false analogy (Scott&rsquo;s denial of his own authorship
of his novels), and, secondly, by the suppression of such a
familiar fact as the constant inconsistency of Ben&rsquo;s
judgments of his contemporaries in literature.&nbsp; Mr.
Greenwood must have forgotten the many examples of this
inconsistency; but I have met a Baconian author who knew nothing
of the fact.&nbsp; Mr. Greenwood, it is proper to say, does not
seem to be satisfied that he has solved what he calls &ldquo;the
Jonsonian riddle.&rdquo;&nbsp; Really, there is no riddle.&nbsp;
About Will, as about other authors, his contemporaries and even
his friends, on occasion, Ben &ldquo;spoke with two
voices,&rdquo; now in terms of hyperbolical praise, now in
carping tones of <a name="pagexxviii"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. xxviii</span>censure.&nbsp; That is the
obvious solution of &ldquo;the Jonsonian riddle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I must apologise if I have in places spelled the name of the
Swan of Avon &ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo; where Mr. Greenwood would
write &ldquo;Shakspere,&rdquo; and <i>vice versa</i>.&nbsp; He
uses &ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo; where he means the Author;
&ldquo;Shakspere&rdquo; where he means Will; and is vexed with
some people who write the name of Will as
&ldquo;Shakespeare.&rdquo;&nbsp; As Will, in the opinion of a
considerable portion of the human race, and of myself, <i>was</i>
the Author, one is apt to write his name as
&ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo; in the usual way.&nbsp; But difficult
cases occur, as in quotations, and in conditional
sentences.&nbsp; By any spelling of the name I always mean the
undivided personality of &ldquo;Him who sleeps by
Avon.&rdquo;</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE BACONIAN AND ANTI-WILLIAN
POSITIONS</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Till</span> the years 1856&ndash;7 no
voice was raised against the current belief about Shakespeare
(1564&ndash;1616).&nbsp; He was the author in the main of the
plays usually printed as his.&nbsp; In some cases other authors,
one or more, may have had fingers in his dramas; in other cases,
Shakespeare may have &ldquo;written over&rdquo; and transfigured
earlier plays, of himself and of others; he may have contributed,
more or less, to several plays mainly by other men.&nbsp;
Separately printed dramas published during his time carry his
name on their title-pages, but are not included in the first
collected edition of his dramas, &ldquo;The First Folio,&rdquo;
put forth by two of his friends and fellow-actors, in 1623, seven
years after his death.</p>
<p>On all these matters did commentators, critics, and
antiquarians for long dispute; but none denied that the actor,
Will Shakspere (spelled as heaven pleased), was in the main the
author of most of the plays of 1623, and the sole author of
<i>Venus and Adonis</i>, <i>Lucrece</i>, and the Sonnets.</p>
<p>Even now, in England at least, it would be perhaps impossible
to find one special and professed student of Elizabethan
literature, and of <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>the classical and European literatures, who does not hold
by the ancient belief, the belief of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
contemporaries and intimates, the belief that he was, in the
sense explained above, the author of the plays.</p>
<p>But ours is not a generation to be overawed by
&ldquo;Authority&rdquo; (as it is called).&nbsp; A small but
eager company of scholars have convinced themselves that Francis
Bacon wrote the Shakespearean plays.&nbsp; That is the point of
agreement among these enthusiasts: points of difference are
numerous: some very wild little sects exist.&nbsp; Meanwhile
multitudes of earnest and intelligent men and women, having read
notices in newspapers of the Baconian books, or heard of them at
lectures and tea-parties, disbelieve in the authorship of
&ldquo;the Stratford rustic,&rdquo; and look down on the faithful
of Will Shakespere with extreme contempt.</p>
<p>From the Baconians we receive a plain straightforward theory,
&ldquo;Bacon wrote Shakespeare,&rdquo; as one of their own
prophets has said. <a name="citation4a"></a><a href="#footnote4a"
class="citation">[4a]</a>&nbsp; Since we have plenty of evidence
for Bacon&rsquo;s life and occupations during the period of
Shakespearean poetic activity, we can compare what he was doing
as a man, a student, a Crown lawyer, a pleader in the Courts, a
political pamphleteer, essayist, courtier, active member of
Parliament, and so on, with what he is said to have been <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>doing&mdash;by
the Baconians; namely, writing two dramas yearly.</p>
<p>But there is another &ldquo;Anti-Willian&rdquo; theory, which
would dethrone Will Shakspere, and put but a Shadow in his
place.&nbsp; Conceive a &ldquo;concealed poet,&rdquo; of high
social position, contemporary with Bacon and Shakespeare.&nbsp;
Let him be so fond of the Law that he cannot keep legal
&ldquo;shop&rdquo; out of his love Sonnets even.&nbsp; Make him a
courtier; a statesman; a philosopher; a scholar who does not
blench even from the difficult Latin of Ovid and Plautus.&nbsp;
Let this almost omniscient being possess supreme poetic genius,
extensive classical attainments, and a tendency to make false
quantities.&nbsp; Then conceive him to live through the reigns of
&ldquo;Eliza and our James,&rdquo; without leaving in history, in
science, in society, in law, in politics or scholarship, a single
trace of his existence.&nbsp; He left nothing but the poems and
plays usually attributed to Will.&nbsp; As to the date of his
decease, we only know that it must necessarily have been later
than the composition of the last genuine Shakespearean
play&mdash;for this paragon wrote it.</p>
<p>Such is the Being who occupies, in the theory of the
non-Baconian, <i>but not Anti-Baconian</i>, Anti-Willians, the
intellectual throne filled, in the Will Shakespeare theory, by
Will; and in the Baconian, by Bacon&mdash;two kings of Brentford
on one throne.</p>
<p>We are to be much engaged by the form of <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>this theory
which is held by Mr. G. G. Greenwood in his <i>The Shakespeare
Problem Restated</i>.&nbsp; In attempting to explain what he
means I feel that I am skating on very thin ice.&nbsp; Already,
in two volumes (<i>In Re Shakespeare</i>, 1909, and <i>The
Vindicators of Shakespeare</i>), Mr. Greenwood has accused his
critics of frequently misconceiving and misrepresenting his
ideas: wherefore I also tremble.&nbsp; I am perfectly confident
in saying that he &ldquo;holds no brief for the
Baconians.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is <i>not</i> a Baconian.&nbsp; His
position is negative merely: Will of Stratford is <i>not</i> the
author of the Shakespearean plays and poems.&nbsp; Then who
is?&nbsp; Mr. Greenwood believes that work by an unknown number
of hands exists in the plays first published all together in
1623.&nbsp; Here few will differ from him.&nbsp; But, setting
aside this aspect of the case, Mr. Greenwood appears to me to
believe in an entity named &ldquo;Shakespeare,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;the Author,&rdquo; who is the predominating partner;
though Mr. Greenwood does not credit him with all the plays in
the Folio of 1623 (nor, perhaps, with the absolute entirety of
any given play).&nbsp; &ldquo;The Author&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo; is not a syndicate (like the Homer of
many critics), but an individual human being, apparently of the
male sex.&nbsp; As to the name by which he was called on earth,
Mr. Greenwood is &ldquo;agnostic.&rdquo;&nbsp; He himself is not
Anti-Baconian.&nbsp; He does not oust Bacon and put the Unknown
in his place.&nbsp; He neither affirms nor denies that Bacon may
<a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>have
contributed, more or less, to the bulk of Shakespearean
work.&nbsp; To put it briefly: Mr. Greenwood backs the field
against the favourite (our Will), and Bacon <i>may</i> be in the
field.&nbsp; If he has any part in the whole I suspect that it is
&ldquo;the lion&rsquo;s part,&rdquo; but Mr. Greenwood does not
commit himself to anything positive.&nbsp; We shall find (if I am
not mistaken) that Mr. Greenwood regards the hypothesis of the
Baconians as &ldquo;an extremely reasonable one,&rdquo; <a
name="citation7a"></a><a href="#footnote7a"
class="citation">[7a]</a> and that for his purposes it would be
an extremely serviceable one, if not even essential.&nbsp; For as
Bacon was a genius to whose potentialities one can set no limit,
he is something to stand by, whereas we cannot easily
believe&mdash;I cannot believe&mdash;that the actual
&ldquo;Author,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo; lived and
died and left no trace of his existence except his share in the
works called Shakespearean.</p>
<p>However, the idea of the Great Unknown has, for its partisans,
this advantage, that as the life of the august Shade is wholly
unknown, we cannot, as in Bacon&rsquo;s case, show how he was
occupied while the plays were being composed.&nbsp; He
<i>must</i>, however, have been much at Court, we learn, and deep
in the mysteries of legal terminology.&nbsp; Was he Sir Edward
Coke?&nbsp; Was he James VI and I?</p>
<p>It is hard, indeed, to set forth the views of the Baconians
and of the &ldquo;Anti-Willians&rdquo; in a shape which will
satisfy them.&nbsp; The task, especially <a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>when undertaken
by an unsympathetic person, is perhaps impossible.&nbsp; I can
only summarise their views in my own words as far as I presume to
understand them.&nbsp; I conceive the Baconians to cry that
&ldquo;the world possesses a mass of transcendent literature,
attributed to a man named William
<i>Shakespeare</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of a man named William
<i>Shakspere</i> (there are many varieties of spelling) we
certainly know that he was born (1564) and bred in
Stratford-on-Avon, a peculiarly dirty, stagnant, and ignorant
country town.&nbsp; There is absolutely no evidence that he (or
any Stratford boy of his standing) ever went to Stratford
school.&nbsp; His father, his mother, and his daughter could not
write, but, in signing, made their marks; and if he could write,
which some of us deny, he wrote a terribly bad hand.&nbsp; As far
as late traditions of seventy or eighty years after his death
inform us, he was a butcher&rsquo;s apprentice; and also a
schoolmaster &ldquo;who knew Latin pretty well&rdquo;; and a
poacher.&nbsp; He made, before he was nineteen, a marriage
tainted with what Meg Dods calls &ldquo;ante-nup.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
early had three children, whom he deserted, as he deserted his
wife.&nbsp; He came to London, we do not know when (about 1582,
according to the &ldquo;guess&rdquo; of an antiquary of 1680);
held horses at the door of a theatre (so tradition says), was
promoted to the rank of &ldquo;servitor&rdquo; (whatever that may
mean), became an actor (a vagabond under the Act), and by 1594
played before Queen Elizabeth.&nbsp; <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>He put money in his pocket (heaven
knows how), for by 1597 he was bargaining for the best house in
his native <i>bourgade</i>.&nbsp; He obtained, by nefarious
genealogical falsehoods (too common, alas, in heraldry), the
right to bear arms; and went on acting.&nbsp; In 1610&ndash;11
(?) he retired to his native place.&nbsp; He never took any
interest in his unprinted manuscript plays; though rapacious, he
never troubled himself about his valuable copyrights; never
dreamed of making a collected edition of his works.&nbsp; He died
in 1616, probably of drink taken.&nbsp; Legal documents prove him
to have been a lender of small sums, an avid creditor, a would-be
encloser of commons.&nbsp; In his will he does not bequeath or
mention any books, manuscripts, copyrights, and so forth.&nbsp;
It is utterly incredible, then, that this man wrote the poems and
plays, so rich in poetry, thought, scholarship, and knowledge,
which are attributed to &ldquo;William Shakespeare.&rdquo;&nbsp;
These must be the works of &ldquo;a concealed poet,&rdquo; a
philosopher, a courtier moving in the highest circles, a supreme
legist, and, necessarily, a great poet, and student of the
classics.</p>
<p>No known person of the age but one, Bacon, was a genius, a
legist, a scholar, a great poet, and brilliant courtier, with all
the other qualifications so the author of the plays either was
Francis Bacon&mdash;or some person unknown, who was in all
respects equally distinguished, but kept his light under a
bushel.&nbsp; Consequently the name &ldquo;William
Shakespeare&rdquo; is a pseudonym or &ldquo;pen-name&rdquo; <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>wisely
adopted by Bacon (or the other man) as early as 1593, at a time
when William Shakspere was notoriously an actor in the company
which produced the plays of the genius styling himself
&ldquo;William Shakespeare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let me repeat that, to the best of my powers of understanding
and of expression, and in my own words, so as to misquote nobody,
I have now summarised the views of the Baconians <i>sans
phrase</i>, and of the more cautious or more credulous
&ldquo;Anti-Willians,&rdquo; as I may style the party who deny to
Will the actor any share in the authorship of the plays, but do
not overtly assign it to Francis Bacon.</p>
<p>Beyond all comparison the best work on the Anti-Willian side
of the controversy is <i>The Shakespeare Problem Restated</i>, by
Mr. G. G. Greenwood (see my Introduction).&nbsp; To this volume I
turn for the exposition of the theory that &ldquo;Will
Shakspere&rdquo; (with many other spellings) is an actor from the
country&mdash;a man of very scanty education, in all probability,
and wholly destitute of books; while &ldquo;William
Shakespeare,&rdquo; or with the hyphen,
&ldquo;Shake-speare,&rdquo; is a &ldquo;<i>nom de
plume</i>&rdquo; adopted by the Great Unknown &ldquo;concealed
poet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I use the word &ldquo;author&rdquo; here, I understand
Mr. Greenwood to mean that in the plays called
&ldquo;Shakespearean&rdquo; there exists work from many pens:
owing to the curious literary manners, methods, and ethics of
dramatic writing in, say, 1589&ndash;1611.&nbsp; In my own poor
opinion this is <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>certainly true of several plays in the first collected
edition, &ldquo;The Folio,&rdquo; produced seven years after
Will&rsquo;s death, namely in 1623.&nbsp; These curious
&ldquo;collective&rdquo; methods of play-writing are to be
considered later.</p>
<p>Matters become much more perplexing when we examine the theory
that &ldquo;William Shake-speare&rdquo; (with or without the
hyphen), on the title-pages of plays, or when signed to the
dedications of poems, is the chosen pen-name, or &ldquo;<i>nom de
plume</i>,&rdquo; of Bacon or of the Unknown.</p>
<p>Here I must endeavour to summarise what Mr. Greenwood has
written <a name="citation11a"></a><a href="#footnote11a"
class="citation">[11a]</a> on the name of the actor, and the
&ldquo;<i>nom de plume</i>&rdquo; of the unknown author who, by
the theory, was not the actor.&nbsp; Let me first confess my firm
belief that there is no cause for all the copious writing about
the spellings &ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Shake-speare&rdquo;&mdash;as indicating the true but
&ldquo;concealed poet&rdquo;&mdash;and &ldquo;Shakspere&rdquo;
(&amp;c.), as indicating the Warwickshire rustic.&nbsp; At
Stratford and in Warwickshire the clan-name was spelled in scores
of ways, was spelled in different ways within a single
document.&nbsp; If the actor himself uniformly wrote
&ldquo;Shakspere&rdquo; (it seems that we have but five
signatures), he was accustomed to seeing the name spelled
variously in documents concerning him and his affairs.&nbsp; In
London the printers aimed at a kind of uniformity,
&ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo; or &ldquo;Shake-speare&rdquo;: and even
if he wrote his <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>own name otherwise, to him it was indifferent.&nbsp;
Lawyers and printers might choose their own mode of
spelling&mdash;and there is no more in the matter.</p>
<p>I must now summarise briefly, in my own words, save where
quotations are indicated in the usual way, the results of Mr.
Greenwood&rsquo;s researches.&nbsp; &ldquo;The family of William
Shakspere of Stratford&rdquo; (perhaps it were safer to say
&ldquo;the members of his name&rdquo;) &ldquo;wrote their name in
many different ways&mdash;some sixty, I believe, have been noted
. . . but the form &lsquo;Shakespeare&rsquo; seems never to have
been employed by them&rdquo;; and, according to Mr. Spedding,
&ldquo;Shakspere of Stratford never so wrote his name &lsquo;in
any known case.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; (According to many Baconians
he never wrote his name in his life.)&nbsp; On the other hand,
the dedications of <i>Venus and Adonis</i> (1593) and of
<i>Lucrece</i> (1594) are inscribed &ldquo;William
Shakespeare&rdquo; (without the hyphen).&nbsp; In 1598, the
title-page of <i>Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost</i> &ldquo;bore
the name W. Shakespere,&rdquo; while in the same year <i>Richard
II</i> and <i>Richard III</i> bear &ldquo;William
Shake-speare,&rdquo; with the hyphen (not without it, as in the
two dedications by the Author).&nbsp; &ldquo;The name which
appears in the body of the conveyance and of the mortgage
bearing&rdquo; (the actor&rsquo;s) &ldquo;signature is
&lsquo;Shakespeare,&rsquo; while &lsquo;Shackspeare&rsquo;
appears in the will, prepared, as we must presume, by or under
the directions of Francis Collyns, the Stratford solicitor, who
was one of the witnesses thereto&rdquo; (and received a legacy of
&pound;13, 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>).</p>

<p><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>Thus,
at Stratford even, the name was spelled, in legal papers, as it
is spelled in the two dedications, and in most of the
title-pages&mdash;and also is spelled otherwise, as
&ldquo;Shackspeare.&rdquo;&nbsp; In March 1594 the actor&rsquo;s
name is spelled &ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo; in Treasury
accounts.&nbsp; The legal and the literary and Treasury spellings
(and conveyances and mortgages and wills are <i>not</i>
literature) are Shakespeare, Shackspeare, Shake-speare,
Shakespere&mdash;all four are used, but we must regard the actor
as never signing &ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo; in any of these
varieties of spelling&mdash;if sign he ever did; at all events he
is not known to have used the <i>a</i> in the last syllable.</p>
<p>I now give the essence of Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s words <a
name="citation13a"></a><a href="#footnote13a"
class="citation">[13a]</a> concerning the <i>nom de plume</i> of
the &ldquo;concealed poet,&rdquo; whoever he was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now a word upon the name
&lsquo;Shakespeare.&rsquo;&nbsp; That in this form, and more
especially with a hyphen, Shake-speare, the word makes an
excellent <i>nom de plume</i> is obvious.&nbsp; As old Thomas
Fuller remarks, the name suggests <i>Martial</i> in its warlike
sound, &lsquo;Hasti-vibrans or Shake-speare.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is
of course further suggestive of Pallas Minerva, the goddess of
Wisdom, for Pallas also was a spear-shaker (Pallas
&#8048;&pi;&#8056; &tau;&omicron;&upsilon;
&pi;&#940;&lambda;&lambda;&epsilon;&iota;&nu; &tau;&#8056;
&delta;&#972;&rho;&upsilon;); and all will remember Ben
Jonson&rsquo;s verses . . . &rdquo; on Shakespeare&rsquo;s
&ldquo;true-filed lines&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In each of which he seems to shake a
lance,<br />
As brandished at the eyes of ignorance.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>There
is more about Pallas in book-titles (to which additions can
easily be made), and about &ldquo;Jonson&rsquo;s Cri-spinus or
Cri-spinas,&rdquo; but perhaps we have now the gist of Mr.
Greenwood&rsquo;s remarks on the &ldquo;excellent <i>nom de
plume</i>&rdquo; (<i>cf.</i> pp. 31&ndash;37.&nbsp; On the whole
of this, <i>cf. The Shakespeare Problem Restated</i>, pp.
293&ndash;295; a <i>nom de plume</i> called a
&ldquo;pseudonym,&rdquo; pp. 307, 312; Shakespeare &ldquo;a mask
name,&rdquo; p. 328; a &ldquo;pseudonym,&rdquo; p. 330;
&ldquo;<i>nom de plume</i>,&rdquo; p. 335).</p>
<p>Now why was the &ldquo;<i>nom de plume</i>&rdquo; or
&ldquo;pseudonym&rdquo; &ldquo;William Shakespeare&rdquo;
&ldquo;an excellent <i>nom de plume</i>&rdquo; for a concealed
author, courtier, lawyer, scholar, and so forth?&nbsp; If
&ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo; suggested Pallas Athene, goddess of
wisdom and of many other things, and so was appropriate, why add
&ldquo;William&rdquo;?</p>
<p>In 1593, when the &ldquo;pseudonym&rdquo; first appears in
<i>Venus and Adonis</i>, a country actor whose name, in legal
documents&mdash;presumably drawn up by or for his friend, Francis
Collyns at Stratford&mdash;is written &ldquo;William
Shakespeare,&rdquo; was before the town as an actor in the
leading company, that of the Lord Chamberlain.&nbsp; This company
produced the plays some of which, by 1598, bear &ldquo;W.
Shakespere,&rdquo; or &ldquo;William Shakespeare&rdquo; on their
title-pages.&nbsp; Thus, even if the actor habitually spelled his
name &ldquo;Shakspere,&rdquo; &ldquo;William Shakespeare&rdquo;
was, practically (on the Baconian theory), not only a pseudonym
of one man, a poet, but also the real name of another man, a
well-known actor, who was <i>not</i> the &ldquo;concealed
poet.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>&ldquo;William Shakespeare&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Shakespere&rdquo; was thus, in my view, the ideally worst
pseudonym which a poet who wished to be &ldquo;concealed&rdquo;
could possibly have had the fatuity to select.&nbsp; His plays
and poems would be, as they were, universally attributed to the
actor, who is represented as a person conspicuously incapable of
writing them.&nbsp; With Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s arguments against
the certainty of this attribution I deal later.</p>
<p>Had the actor been a man of rare wit, and of good education
and wide reading, the choice of name might have been
judicious.&nbsp; A &ldquo;concealed poet&rdquo; of high social
standing, with a strange fancy for rewriting the plays of
contemporary playwrights, might obtain the manuscript copies from
their owners, the Lord Chamberlain&rsquo;s Company, through that
knowledgeable, witty, and venal member of the company, Will
Shakspere.&nbsp; He might then rewrite and improve them, more or
less, as it was his whim to do.&nbsp; The actor might make fair
copies in his own hand, give them to his company, and say that
the improved works were from his own pen and genius.&nbsp; The
lie might pass, but only if the actor, in his life and witty
talk, seemed very capable of doing what he pretended to have
done.&nbsp; But if the actor, according to some Baconians, could
not write even his own name, he was impossible as a mask for the
poet.&nbsp; He was also impossible, I think, if he were what Mr.
Greenwood describes him to be.</p>
<p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>Mr.
Greenwood, in his view of the actor as he was when he came to
London, does not deny to him the gift of being able to sign his
name.&nbsp; But, if he were educated at Stratford Free School (of
which there is no documentary record), according to Mr.
Halliwell-Phillipps &ldquo;he was removed from school long before
the usual age,&rdquo; &ldquo;in all probability&rdquo; when
&ldquo;he was about thirteen&rdquo; (an age at which some boys,
later well known, went up to their universities).&nbsp; If we
send him to school at seven or so, &ldquo;it appears that he
could only have enjoyed such advantages as it may be supposed to
have provided for a period of five or six years at the
outside.&nbsp; He was then withdrawn, and, as it seems, put to
calf-slaughtering.&rdquo; <a name="citation16a"></a><a
href="#footnote16a" class="citation">[16a]</a></p>
<p>What the advantages may have been we try to estimate
later.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood, with Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps, thinks that Will
&ldquo;could have learned but little there.&nbsp; No doubt boys
at Elizabethan grammar schools, if they remained long enough, had
a good deal of Latin driven into them.&nbsp; Latin, indeed, was
the one subject that was taught; and an industrious boy who had
gone through the course and attained to the higher classes would
generally be able to write fair Latin prose.&nbsp; But he would
learn very little else&rdquo; (except to write fair Latin
prose?).&nbsp; &ldquo;What we now call &lsquo;culture&rsquo;
certainly did not enter into the &lsquo;curriculum,&rsquo; nor
&lsquo;English,&rsquo; nor modern languages, nor
&lsquo;literature.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation17a"></a><a
href="#footnote17a" class="citation">[17a]</a>&nbsp; <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>Mr.
Halliwell-Phillipps says that &ldquo;removed prematurely from
school, residing with illiterate relatives in a bookless
neighbourhood, thrown into the midst of occupations adverse to
scholastic progress&mdash;it is difficult to believe that when he
first left Stratford he was not all but destitute of polished
accomplishments.&rdquo; <a name="citation17b"></a><a
href="#footnote17b" class="citation">[17b]</a>&nbsp; Mr.
Greenwood adds the apprenticeship to a butcher or draper, but
doubts the poaching, and the frequent whippings and
imprisonments, as in the story told by the Rev. R. Davies in
1708. <a name="citation17c"></a><a href="#footnote17c"
class="citation">[17c]</a></p>
<p>That this promising young man, &ldquo;when he came to London,
spoke the Warwickshire dialect or <i>patois</i> is, then, as
certain as anything can be that is incapable of mathematical
proof.&rdquo; <a name="citation17d"></a><a href="#footnote17d"
class="citation">[17d]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Here is the young
Warwickshire provincial . . . &rdquo; <a
name="citation17e"></a><a href="#footnote17e"
class="citation">[17e]</a> producing, apparently five or six
years after his arrival in town, <i>Venus and Adonis</i> . . .
&ldquo;Is it conceivable that this was the work of the Stratford
Player of whom we know so little, but of whom we know so much too
much?&nbsp; If so we have here a veritable sixteenth-century
miracle.&rdquo; <a name="citation17f"></a><a href="#footnote17f"
class="citation">[17f]</a>&nbsp; Moreover, &ldquo;our great
supposed poet and dramatist had at his death neither book nor
manuscript in his possession, or to which he was legally
entitled, or in which he had any interest whatever.&rdquo; <a
name="citation17g"></a><a href="#footnote17g"
class="citation">[17g]</a></p>
<p>If it be not conceivable now that the rustic speaking in a
<i>patois</i> could write <i>Venus and Adonis</i>, <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>manifestly it
was inconceivable in 1593, when <i>Venus and Adonis</i> was
signed &ldquo;William Shakespeare.&rdquo;&nbsp; No man who knew
the actor (as described) could believe that he was the author,
but there does not exist the most shadowy hint proving that the
faintest doubt was thrown on the actor&rsquo;s authorship;
ignorant as he was, bookless, and rude of speech.&nbsp; For such
a Will as Mr. Greenwood describes to persuade the literary and
dramatic world of his age that he <i>did</i> write the plays,
would have been a miracle.&nbsp; Consequently Mr. Greenwood has
to try to persuade us that there is no sufficient evidence that
Will <i>did</i> persuade, say Ben Jonson, of his authorship and
we shall see whether or not he works this twentieth-century
miracle of persuasion.</p>
<p>Of course if Will were unable to write even his name, as an
enthusiastic Baconian asserts, Mr. Greenwood sees that Will could
not easily pass for the Author. <a name="citation18a"></a><a
href="#footnote18a" class="citation">[18a]</a>&nbsp; But his own
bookless actor with a <i>patois</i> seems to him, as author of
<i>Venus and Adonis</i>, almost inconceivable.&nbsp; Yet, despite
Will&rsquo;s bookless rusticity, this poem with <i>Lucrece</i>,
which displays knowledge of a work of Ovid not translated into
English by 1593, was regarded as his own.&nbsp; I must suppose,
therefore, that Will was <i>not</i> manifestly so ignorant of
Latin as Mr. Greenwood thinks.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think it highly
probable,&rdquo; says this critic, &ldquo;that he attended the
Grammar School at Stratford&rdquo; (where nothing but Latin <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>was taught)
&ldquo;for four or five years, and that, later in life, after
some years in London, he was probably able to &lsquo;bumbast out
a line,&rsquo; and perhaps to pose as &lsquo;Poet-Ape that would
be thought our chief.&rsquo;&nbsp; Nay, I am not at all sure that
he would not have been capable of collaborating with such a man
as George Wilkins, and perhaps of writing quite as well as he, if
not even better.&nbsp; But it does not follow from this that he
was the author either of <i>Venus and Adonis</i> or of
<i>Hamlet</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation19a"></a><a
href="#footnote19a" class="citation">[19a]</a></p>
<p>Nothing follows from all this: we merely see that, in Mr.
Greenwood&rsquo;s private opinion, the actor might write even
better than George Wilkins, but could not write <i>Venus and
Adonis</i>.&nbsp; Will, therefore, though bookless, is not
debarred here from the pursuits of literature, in partnership
with Wilkins.&nbsp; We have merely the critic&rsquo;s opinion
that Will could not write <i>Hamlet</i>, even if, like
Wordsworth, &ldquo;he had the mind,&rdquo; even if the gods had
made him more poetical than Wilkins.</p>
<p>Again, &ldquo;he had had but little schooling; he had
&lsquo;small Latin and less Greek&rsquo;&rdquo; (as Ben Jonson
truly says), &ldquo;but he was a good <i>Johannes Factotum</i>;
he could arrange a scene, and, when necessary, &lsquo;bumbast out
a blank verse.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation19b"></a><a
href="#footnote19b" class="citation">[19b]</a></p>
<p>The &ldquo;<i>Johannes Factotum</i>,&rdquo; who could
&ldquo;bumbast out a blank verse,&rdquo; is taken from Robert <a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>Greene&rsquo;s hackneyed attack on an actor-poet,
&ldquo;Shake-scene,&rdquo; published in 1592.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Poet-Ape that would be thought our chief,&rdquo; is from
an epigram on an actor-poet by Ben Jonson (1601&ndash;16?).&nbsp;
If the allusions by Greene and Jonson are to our Will, he, by
1592, had a literary ambition so towering that he thought his own
work in the new art of dramatic blank verse was equal to that of
Marlowe (not to speak of Wilkins), and Greene reckoned him a
dangerous rival to three of his playwright friends, of whom
Marlowe is one, apparently.</p>
<p>If Jonson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Poet-Ape&rdquo; be meant for Will, by
1601 Will would fain &ldquo;be thought the chief&rdquo; of
contemporary dramatists.&nbsp; His vanity soared far above George
Wilkins!&nbsp; Greene&rsquo;s phrases and Jonson&rsquo;s are
dictated by spite, jealousy, and envy; and from them a true view
of the work of the man whom they envy, the actor-poet, cannot be
obtained.&nbsp; We might as well judge Moli&egrave;re in the
spirit of the author of <i>Elomire Hypocondre</i>, and of de
Vis&eacute;!&nbsp; The Anti-Willian arguments keep on appearing,
going behind the scenes, and reappearing, like a stage
army.&nbsp; To avoid this phenomenon I reserve what is to be said
about &ldquo;Shake-scene&rdquo; and &ldquo;Poet-Ape&rdquo; for
another place (pp. 138&ndash;145 <i>infra</i>).&nbsp; But I must
give the reader a warning.&nbsp; Concerning &ldquo;William
Shakespeare&rdquo; as a &ldquo;<i>nom de plume</i>,&rdquo; or
pseudonym, Mr. Greenwood says, &ldquo;Some, indeed, would see
through it, and roundly accuse the <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>player of putting forth the works of
others as his own.&nbsp; To such he would be a
&lsquo;Poet-Ape,&rsquo; or &lsquo;an upstart crow&rsquo;
(Shake-scene) &lsquo;beautified with the feathers of other
writers.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation21a"></a><a
href="#footnote21a" class="citation">[21a]</a></p>
<p>If this be true, if &ldquo;some would see through&rdquo; (Mr.
Greenwood, apparently, means <i>did</i> &ldquo;see
through&rdquo;) the &ldquo;<i>nom de plume</i>,&rdquo; the case
of the Anti-Willians is promising.&nbsp; But, in this matter, Mr.
Greenwood <i>se trompe</i>.&nbsp; Neither Greene nor Jonson
accused &ldquo;Shake-scene&rdquo; or &ldquo;Poet-Ape&rdquo; of
&ldquo;putting forth the works of others as his own.&rdquo;&nbsp;
That is quite certain, as far as the scorns of Jonson and Greene
have reached us.&nbsp; (See pp. 141&ndash;145 <i>infra</i>.)</p>
<p>If an actor, obviously incapable of wit and poetry, were
credited with the plays, the keenest curiosity would arise in
&ldquo;the profession,&rdquo; and among rival playwrights who
envied the wealth and &ldquo;glory&rdquo; of the actors.&nbsp;
This curiosity, prompting the wits and players to watch and
&ldquo;shadow&rdquo; Will, would, to put it mildly, most
seriously imperil the secret of the concealed author who had the
folly to sign himself &ldquo;William Shakespeare.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Human nature could not rest under such a provocation as the
&ldquo;concealed poet&rdquo; offered.</p>
<p>This is so obvious that had one desired to prove Bacon or the
Unknown to be the concealed author, one must have credited his
mask, Will, with abundance of wit and fancy, and, as for <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>learning&mdash;with about as much as he probably
possessed.&nbsp; But the Baconians make him an illiterate yokel,
and we have quoted Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s estimate of the young
Warwickshire provincial.</p>
<p>We all have our personal equations in the way of belief.&nbsp;
That the plot of the &ldquo;<i>nom de plume</i>&rdquo; should
have evaded discovery for a week, if the actor were the untutored
countryman of the hypotheses, is to me, for one, absolutely
incredible.&nbsp; A &ldquo;concealed poet&rdquo; looking about
for a &ldquo;<i>nom de plume</i>&rdquo; and a mask behind which
he could be hidden, would not have selected the name, or the
nearest possible approach to the name, of an ignorant unread
actor.&nbsp; As he was never suspected of not being the author of
the plays and poems, Will cannot have been a country ignoramus,
manifestly incapable of poetry, wit, and such learning as the
plays exhibit.&nbsp; Every one must judge for himself.&nbsp; Mr.
Greenwood fervently believes in what I disbelieve. <a
name="citation22a"></a><a href="#footnote22a"
class="citation">[22a]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Very few Englishmen . . . in Elizabethan <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>times,
concerned themselves at all, or cared one brass farthing, about
the authorship of plays . . . &rdquo; says Mr. Greenwood.</p>
<p>Very few care now.&nbsp; They know the actors&rsquo; names: in
vain, as a rule, do I ask playgoers for the name of the author of
their entertainment.&nbsp; But in Elizabeth&rsquo;s time the few
who cared were apt to care very much, and they would inquire
intensely when the Stratford actor, a bookless, untaught man, was
announced as the author of plays which were among the most
popular of their day.&nbsp; The seekers never found any other
author.&nbsp; They left no hint that they suspected the existence
of any other author.&nbsp; Hence I venture to infer that Will
seemed to them no unread rustic, but a fellow of infinite
fancy,&mdash;no scholar to be sure, but very capable of writing
the pieces which he fathered.</p>
<p>They may all have been mistaken.&nbsp; Nobody can prove that
Heywood and Ben Jonson, and the actors of the Company, were not
mistaken.&nbsp; But certain it is that they thought the Will whom
<a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>they knew
capable of the works which were attributed to him.&nbsp;
Therefore he cannot possibly have been the man who could not
write, of the more impulsive Baconians; or the bookless, and
probably all but Latinless, man of Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s
theory.&nbsp; The positions already seem to me to be
untenable.</p>
<h2><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>II<br
/>
<span class="GutSmall">THE &ldquo;SILENCE&rdquo; ABOUT
SHAKESPEARE</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> proceeding further to
examine Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s book, and the Baconian theories,
with the careful attention which they deserve, we must clear the
ground by explaining two points which appear to puzzle Baconians,
though, to be sure, they have their own solutions of the
problems.</p>
<p>The first question is: Why, considering that Shakespeare, by
the consent of the learned of most of the polite foreign nations,
was one of the world&rsquo;s very greatest poets, have we
received so few and such brief notices of him from the pens of
his contemporaries?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is wonderful,&rdquo; exclaims Mr. Crouch-Batchelor,
&ldquo;that hundreds of persons should not have left records of
him. <a name="citation27a"></a><a href="#footnote27a"
class="citation">[27a]</a>&nbsp; We know nearly as much about the
most insignificant writer of the period as we know of him, but
fifty times more about most of his contemporaries.&nbsp; It is
senseless to try to account for this otherwise than by
recognising that the man was not the author.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Crouch-Batchelor is too innocent.&nbsp; He sees the
sixteenth century in the colours of the <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>twentieth.&nbsp; We know nothing, except a few dates of
birth, death, entrance at school, College, the Inns of Court, and
so forth, concerning several of Shakespeare&rsquo;s illustrious
contemporaries and successors in the art of dramatic
poetry.&nbsp; The Baconians do not quite understand, or, at
least, keep steadily before their minds, one immense difference
between the Elizabethan age and later times.&nbsp; In
1590&ndash;1630, there was no public excitement about the
characters, personalities, and anecdotage of merely literary men,
poets, and playwrights, who held no position in public affairs,
as Spenser did; or in Court, Society, and War, as Sidney did; who
did not write about their own feuds and friendships, like Greene
and Nash; who did not expand into prefaces and reminiscences, and
satires, like Ben Jonson; who never killed anybody, as Ben did;
nor were killed, like Marlowe; nor were involved, like him, in
charges of atheism, and so forth; nor imprisoned with every
chance of having their ears and noses slit, like Marston.&nbsp;
Consequently, silence and night obscure the lives and
personalities of Kyd, Chapman, Beaumont, Fletcher, Dekker,
Webster, and several others, as night and silence hide
Shakespeare from our view.</p>
<p>He was popular on the stage; some of his plays were circulated
separately in cheap and very perishable quartos.&nbsp; No
collected edition of his plays appeared during his life; without
that he could not be studied, and recognised in his <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>greatness.&nbsp; He withdrew to the country and
died.&nbsp; There was no enthusiastic curiosity about him; nobody
Boswellised any playwright of his time.&nbsp; The Folio of 1623
gave the first opportunity of studying him as alone he can be
studied.&nbsp; The Civil Wars and the Reign of the Saints
distracted men&rsquo;s minds and depressed or destroyed the
Stage.</p>
<p>Sir William Davenant, a boy when Shakespeare died, used to see
the actor at his father&rsquo;s inn at Oxford, was interested in
him, and cherished the embers of the drama, which were fading
before the theatres were closed.&nbsp; Davenant collected what he
could in the way of information from old people of the stage; he
told Shakespearean anecdotes in conversation; a few reached the
late day when uncritical inquiries began, say 1680&ndash;90 at
earliest.&nbsp; The memories of ancient people of the theatre and
clerks and sextons at Stratford were ransacked, to very little
purpose.</p>
<p>As these things were so, how can we expect biographical
materials about Shakespeare?&nbsp; As to the man, as to how his
character impressed contemporaries, we have but the current
epithets: &ldquo;friendly,&rdquo; &ldquo;gentle,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;sweet,&rdquo; the praise of his worth by two of the actors
in his company (published in 1623), and the brief prose note of
Ben Jonson,&mdash;this is more than we have for the then so
widely admired Beaumont, Ben Jonson&rsquo;s friend, or Chapman,
or the adored Fletcher.&nbsp; &ldquo;Into the dark go one and
all,&rdquo; Shakespeare and the others.&nbsp; <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>To be puzzled
by and found theories on the silence about Shakespeare is to show
an innocence very odd in learned disputants.</p>
<p>The Baconians, as usual, make a puzzle and a mystery out of
their own misappreciation of the literary and social conditions
of Shakespeare&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; That world could not possibly
appreciate his works as we do; the world, till 1623, possessed
only a portion of his plays in cheap pamphlets, in several of
these his text was mangled and in places unintelligible.&nbsp;
And in not a single instance were anecdotes and biographical
traits of playwrights recorded, except when the men published
matter about themselves, or when they became notorious in some
way unconnected with their literary works.&nbsp; Drummond, in
Scotland, made brief notes of Ben Jonson&rsquo;s talk;
Shakespeare he never met.</p>
<p>That age was not widely and enthusiastically appreciative of
literary merit in playwrights who were merely dramatists, and in
no other way notorious or eminent.&nbsp; Mr. Greenwood justly
says &ldquo;the contemporary eulogies of the poet afford proof
that there were some cultured critics of that day of sufficient
taste and acumen to recognise, or partly recognise, his
excellence . . . &rdquo; <a name="citation30a"></a><a
href="#footnote30a" class="citation">[30a]</a>&nbsp; (Here I omit
some words, presently to be restored to the text.)&nbsp; From
such critics the poet received such applause as has reached us.
We also know that the plays were popular; <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>but the
audiences have not rushed to pen and ink to record their
satisfaction.&nbsp; With them, as with all audiences, the actors
and the <i>spectacle</i>, much more than the
&ldquo;cackle,&rdquo; were the attractions.&nbsp; When Dr.
Ingleby says that &ldquo;the bard of our admiration was unknown
to the men of that age,&rdquo; he uses hyperbole, and means, I
presume, that he was unknown, as all authors are, to the great
majority; and that those who knew him in part made no modern fuss
about him. <a name="citation31a"></a><a href="#footnote31a"
class="citation">[31a]</a></p>
<p>The second puzzle is,&mdash;Why did Shakespeare, conscious of
his great powers, never secure for his collected plays the
permanence of print and publication?&nbsp; We cannot be sure that
he and his company, in fact, did not provide publishers with the
copy for the better Quartos or pamphlets of separate plays, as
Mr. Pollard argues on good grounds that they sometimes did. <a
name="citation31b"></a><a href="#footnote31b"
class="citation">[31b]</a>&nbsp; For the rest, no dramatic author
edited a complete edition of his works before Ben Jonson, a
scholarly man, set the example in the year of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s, and of Beaumont&rsquo;s death (1616).&nbsp;
Neither Beaumont nor Fletcher collected and published their works
for the Stage.&nbsp; The idea was unheard of before Jonson set
the example, and much of his work lay unprinted till years <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>after his
death. We must remember the conditions of play-writing in
Shakespeare&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>There were then many poets of no mean merit, all capable of
admirable verse on occasion; and in various degrees possessed of
the lofty, vigorous, and vivid style of that great age.&nbsp; The
theatre, and writing for the theatre, afforded to many men of
talent a means of livelihood analogous to that offered by
journalism among ourselves.&nbsp; They were apt to work
collectively, several hands hurrying out a single play; and in
twos or threes, or fours or fives, they often collaborated.</p>
<p>As a general rule a play when finished was sold by the author
or authors to a company of players, or to a speculator like the
notorious Philip Henslowe, and the new owners, &ldquo;the grand
possessors,&rdquo; were usually averse to the publication of the
work, lest other companies might act it.&nbsp; The plays were
primarily written to be acted.&nbsp; The company in possession
could have the play altered as they pleased by a literary man in
their employment.</p>
<p>To follow Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s summary of the situation
&ldquo;it would seem that an author could restrain any person
from publishing his manuscript, or could bring an action against
him for so doing, so long as he had not disposed of his right to
it; and that the publisher could prevent any other publisher from
issuing the work.&nbsp; At the same time it is clear that the law
was <a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>frequently violated . . . whether because of the
difficulty of enforcing it, or through the supineness of authors;
and that in consequence authors were frequently defrauded by
surreptitious copies of their works being issued by piratical
publishers.&rdquo; <a name="citation33a"></a><a
href="#footnote33a" class="citation">[33a]</a></p>
<p>It may appear that to &ldquo;authors&rdquo; we should, in the
case of plays, add &ldquo;owners,&rdquo; such as theatrical
companies, for no case is cited in which such a company brings an
action against the publisher of a play which they own.&nbsp; The
two players of Shakespeare&rsquo;s company who sign the preface
to the first edition of his collected plays (1623, &ldquo;The
First Folio&rdquo;) complain that &ldquo;divers stolen and
surreptitious copies&rdquo; of single plays have been put forth,
&ldquo;maimed and deformed by the frauds and stealths of
injurious impostors.&rdquo;&nbsp; They speak as if they were
unable to prevent, or had not the energy to prevent, these
frauds.&nbsp; In the accounts of the aforesaid Henslowe, we find
him paying forty shillings to a printer to stop or
&ldquo;stay&rdquo; the printing of a play, <i>Patient Grizel</i>,
by three of his hacks.</p>
<p>We perhaps come across an effort of the company to prevent or
delay the publication of <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>, on July
17, 1598, in the <i>Stationers&rsquo; Register</i>.&nbsp; James
Robertes, and all other printers, are forbidden to print the book
without previous permission from the Lord Chamberlain, the
protector of Will Shakespeare&rsquo;s company.&nbsp; Two years
passed before Robertes issued <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>the book. <a
name="citation34a"></a><a href="#footnote34a"
class="citation">[34a]</a>&nbsp; As is well known, Heywood, a
most prolific playwright, boasts that he never made a double sale
of his pieces to the players and the press.&nbsp; Others
occasionally did, which Heywood clearly thought less than
honest.</p>
<p>As an author who was also an actor, and a shareholder in his
company, Will&rsquo;s interests were the same as theirs.&nbsp; It
is therefore curious that some of his pieces were early printed,
in quartos, from very good copies; while others appeared in very
bad copies, clearly surreptitious.&nbsp; Probably the company
gave a good MS. copy, sometimes, to a printer who offered
satisfactory terms, after the gloss of novelty was off the acted
play. <a name="citation34b"></a><a href="#footnote34b"
class="citation">[34b]</a>&nbsp; In any case, we see that the
custom and interests of the owners of manuscript plays ran
contrary to their early publication.&nbsp; In 1619 even Ben
Jonson, who loved publication, told Drummond that half of his
comedies were still unprinted.</p>
<p>These times were not as our own, and must not be judged by
ours.&nbsp; Whoever wrote the plays, the actor, or Bacon, or the
Man in the Moon; whoever legally owned the manuscripts, was
equally incurious and negligent about the preservation of a
correct text.&nbsp; As we shall see later, while Baconians urge
without any evidence that Bacon himself edited, or gave to Ben
Jonson <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>the
duty of editing, the first collected edition (1623), the work has
been done in an indescribably negligent and reckless manner, and,
as Mr. Greenwood repeatedly states, the edition, in his opinion,
contains at least two plays not by his
&ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo;&mdash;that &ldquo;concealed
poet&rdquo;&mdash;and masses of &ldquo;non-Shakespearean&rdquo;
work.</p>
<p>How this could happen, if Bacon (as on one hypothesis) either
revised the plays himself, or entrusted the task to so strict an
Editor as Ben Jonson, I cannot imagine.&nbsp; This is also one of
the difficulties in Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s theory.&nbsp; Thus we
cannot argue, &ldquo;if the actor were the author, he must have
been conscious of his great powers.&nbsp; Therefore the actor
cannot have been the author, for the actor wholly neglected to
collect his printed and to print his manuscript works.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This argument is equally potent against the authorship of the
plays by Bacon.&nbsp; He, too, left the manuscripts unpublished
till 1623.&nbsp; &ldquo;But he could not avow his
authorship,&rdquo; cry Baconians, giving various exquisite
reasons.&nbsp; Indeed, if Bacon were the author, he might not
care to divulge his long association with &ldquo;a cry of
players,&rdquo; and a man like Will of Stratford.&nbsp; But he
had no occasion to avow it.&nbsp; He had merely to suggest to the
players, through any safe channel, that they should collect and
publish the works of their old friend Will Shakspere.</p>
<p>Thus indifferent was the main author of the plays, whether he
were actor or statesman; and <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>the actor, at least, is not to blame
for the chaos of the first collected edition, made while he was
in his grave, and while Bacon was busy in revising and
superintending Latin translations of his works on scientific
subjects.</p>
<p>We now understand why there are so few contemporary records of
Shakspere the man; and see that the neglect of his texts was
extreme, whether or not he were the author.&nbsp; The neglect was
characteristic of the playwrights of his own and the next
generation.&nbsp; In those days it was no marvel; few
cared.&nbsp; Nine years passed before a second edition of the
collected plays appeared: thirty-two years went by before a third
edition was issued&mdash;years of war and tumult, yet they saw
the posthumous publication of the collected plays of Beaumont and
Fletcher.</p>
<p>There remains one more mystery connected with
publication.&nbsp; When the first collected edition of the plays
appeared, it purported to contain &ldquo;All His Comedies,
Histories, and Tragedies.&rdquo;&nbsp; According to the postulate
of the Baconians it was edited by the Author, or by Jonson acting
for him.&nbsp; It contains several plays which, according to many
critics, are not the author&rsquo;s.&nbsp; This, if true, is
mysterious, and so is the fact that a few plays were published,
as by Shakespeare, in the lifetime both of the actor and of
Bacon; plays which neither acknowledged for his own, for we hear
of no remonstrance from&mdash;whoever &ldquo;William
Shakespeare&rdquo; was.&nbsp; It is impossible <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>for me to say
why there was no remonstrance.</p>
<p>Suppose that Will merely supplied Bacon&rsquo;s plays, under
his own name, with a slight difference in spelling, to his
company.&nbsp; It was as much his interest, in that case, to
protest when Bacon&rsquo;s pen-name was taken in vain, as if he
had spelled his own surname with an <i>a</i> in the second
syllable.</p>
<p>There is another instance which Mr. Greenwood discusses twice.
<a name="citation37a"></a><a href="#footnote37a"
class="citation">[37a]</a>&nbsp; In 1599 Jaggard published
&ldquo;<i>The Passionate Pilgrim</i>; W.
Shakespeare.&rdquo;&nbsp; Out of twenty poems, five only were by
W. S.&nbsp; In 1612, Jaggard added two poems by Tom Heywood,
retaining W. Shakespeare&rsquo;s name as sole author.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Heywood protested&rdquo; in print, &ldquo;and stated that
<i>Shakespeare</i> was offended, and,&rdquo; says Mr. Greenwood,
&ldquo;very probably he was so; but as he was, so I conceive,
&lsquo;a concealed poet,&rsquo; writing under a <i>nom de
plume</i>, he seems to have only made known his annoyance through
the medium of Heywood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If so, Heywood knew who the concealed poet was.&nbsp; Turning
to pp. 348, 349, we find Mr. Greenwood repeating the same story,
with this addition, that the author of the poems published by
Jaggard, &ldquo;to do himself right, hath since published them in
his own name.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is, W. Shakespeare has since
published under his own name such pieces of <i>The Passionate
Pilgrim</i> as <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>are his own.&nbsp; &ldquo;The author, I know,&rdquo;
adds Heywood, &ldquo;was much offended with Mr. Jaggard that
(altogether unknown to him) presumed to make so bold with his
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why was the author so slack when Jaggard, in 1599, published
W. S.&rsquo;s poems with others <i>not</i> by W. S.?</p>
<p>How can anyone explain, by any theory?&nbsp; It was as open to
him in 1599 as in 1612 to publish his own pieces under his own
name, or pen-name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we observe,&rdquo; says Mr. Greenwood, <a
name="citation38a"></a><a href="#footnote38a"
class="citation">[38a]</a> &ldquo;that Heywood does nothing to
identify &lsquo;the author with the player.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp;
This is, we shall see, the eternal argument.&nbsp; Why should
Heywood, speaking of W. Shakespeare, explain what all the world
knew?&nbsp; There was no other W. Shakespeare (with or without
the <i>e</i> and <i>a</i>) but one, the actor, in the world of
letters of Elizabeth and James.&nbsp; Who the author was Heywood
himself has told us, elsewhere: the author was&mdash;Will!</p>
<p>But why Shakespeare was so indifferent to the use of his name,
or, when he was moved, acted so mildly, it is not for me or
anyone to explain.&nbsp; We do not know the nature of the
circumstances in detail; we do not know that the poet saw hopes
of stopping the sale of the works falsely attributed to
him.&nbsp; I do not even feel certain that he had not a finger in
some of them.&nbsp; Knowing so little, a more soaring wit than
mine <a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>might
fly to the explanation that &ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo; was the
&ldquo;<i>nom de plume</i>&rdquo; of Bacon or his unknown
equivalent, and that he preferred to &ldquo;let sleeping dogs
lie,&rdquo; or, as Mr. Greenwood might quote the Latin tag, said
<i>ne moveas Camarinam</i>.</p>
<h2><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>III<br
/>
<span class="GutSmall">THAT IMPOSSIBLE HE&mdash;THE SCHOOLING OF
SHAKESPEARE</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> banner-cry of the Baconians is
the word &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;&nbsp; It is impossible that
the actor from Stratford (as they think of him, a bookless,
untutored lad, speaking in <i>patois</i>) should have possessed
the wide, deep, and accurate scholarship displayed by the author
of the plays and poems.&nbsp; It is impossible that at the little
Free School of Stratford (if he attended it), he should have
gained his wide knowledge of the literatures of Greece and
Rome.&nbsp; To these arguments, the orthodox Stratfordian is apt
to reply, that he finds in the plays and poems plenty of
inaccurate general information on classical subjects, information
in which the whole literature of England then abounded.&nbsp; He
also finds in the plays some knowledge of certain Latin authors,
which cannot be proved to have been translated at the date when
Shakespeare drew on them.&nbsp; How much Latin Shakespeare knew,
in our opinion, will presently be explained.</p>
<p>But, in reply to the Baconians and the Anti-Willians, we must
say that while the author of the plays had some lore which
scholars also possessed, <a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>he did not use his knowledge like a
scholar.&nbsp; We do not see how a scholar could make, as the
scansion of his blank verse proves that the author did make, the
second syllable of the name of Posthumus, in <i>Cymbeline</i>,
<i>long</i>.&nbsp; He must have read a famous line in Horace
thus,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Eheu fugaces Posthoome</i>,
<i>Posthoome</i>!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which could scarce &rsquo;scape whipping, even at Stratford
Free School.&nbsp; In the same way he makes the penultimate
syllable of Andronicus short, equally impossible.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood, we shall see, denies to him <i>Titus
Andronicus</i>, but also appears to credit it to him, as one of
the older plays which he &ldquo;revised, improved, and
dressed,&rdquo; <a name="citation44a"></a><a href="#footnote44a"
class="citation">[44a]</a> and <i>that</i> is taken to have been
all his &ldquo;authorship&rdquo; in several cases.&nbsp; A
scholar would have corrected, not accepted, false
quantities.&nbsp; In other cases, as when Greeks and Trojans cite
Plato and Aristotle in <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>, while Plato
and Aristotle lived more than a thousand years after the latest
conceivable date of the siege of Troy, I cannot possibly suppose
that a scholar would have permitted to himself the freak, any
more than that in <i>The Winter&rsquo;s Tale</i> he should have
borrowed from an earlier novel the absurdity of calling Delphi
&ldquo;Delphos&rdquo; (a non-existent word), of confusing
&ldquo;Delphos&rdquo; with Delos, and placing the Delphian Oracle
in an island.&nbsp; In the same <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>play the author, quite needlessly,
makes the artist Giulio Romano (1492&ndash;1546) contemporary
with the flourishing age of the oracle of the Pythian
Apollo.&nbsp; This, at least, would not be ignorance.</p>
<p>We have, I think, sufficient testimony to Ben&rsquo;s
inability to refrain from gibes at Shakspere&rsquo;s want of
scholarship.&nbsp; Rowe, who had traditions of Davenant&rsquo;s,
tells how, in conversation with Suckling, Davenant, Endymion
Porter, and Hales of Eton, Ben harped on Will&rsquo;s want of
learning; and how Hales snubbed him.&nbsp; Indeed, Ben could have
made mirth enough out of <i>The Winter&rsquo;s Tale</i>.&nbsp;
For, granting to Mr. Greenwood <a name="citation45a"></a><a
href="#footnote45a" class="citation">[45a]</a> that &ldquo;the
mention of Delphos suggests the Bohemia of a much earlier date,
and under the reign of Ottocar (1255&ndash;78) Bohemia extended
from the Adriatic to the shores of the Baltic,&rdquo; that only
makes matters far worse.&nbsp; &ldquo;Delphos&rdquo; never was a
place-name; there was no oracle on the isle of
&ldquo;Delphos&rdquo;; there were no Oracles in 1255&ndash;78
(<span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>); and Perdita, who could have
sat for her portrait to Giulio Romano, was contemporary with an
Oracle at <i>Delphos</i>, but not with Ottocar.</p>
<p>There never was so mad a mixture, not even in <i>Ivanhoe</i>;
not even in <i>Kenilworth</i>.&nbsp; Scott erred deliberately, as
he says in his prefaces; but Will took the insular oracle of
Delphos from Greene, inserted Giulio Romano &ldquo;for his
personal diversion,&rdquo; <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>never heard of Ottocar (no more than
I), and made a delightful congeries of errors in gaiety of
heart.&nbsp; Nobody shall convince me that Francis Bacon was so
charmingly irresponsible; but I cannot speak so confidently of
Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s Great Unknown, a severe scholar, but
perhaps a frisky soul.&nbsp; There was no region called Bohemia
when the Delphic oracle was in vigour;&mdash;this apology
(apparently contrived by Sir Edward Sullivan) is the most comic
of erudite reflections.</p>
<p>Some cruel critic has censured the lovely speech of Perdita,
concerning the flowers which Proserpine let fall, when she was
carried off by Dis.&nbsp; How could she, brought up in the hut of
a Bohemian shepherd, know anything of the Rape of
Proserpine?&nbsp; Why not, as she lived in the days of the
Delphic Oracle&mdash;and Giulio Romano, and of printed
ballads.</p>
<p>It is impossible, Baconians cry, that the rabbit-stealer,
brought up among the Audreys and Jaquenettas of Warwickshire,
should have created the noble and witty ladies of the Court; and
known the style of his Armado; and understood how dukes and kings
talk among themselves&mdash;usually in blank verse, it
appears.</p>
<p>It is impossible that the home-keeping yokel should have heard
of the &ldquo;obscure&rdquo; (<i>sic</i>!) Court of Navarre; and
known that at Venice there was a place called the Rialto, and a
&ldquo;common ferry&rdquo; called &ldquo;the
tranect.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is impossible that he should have had
&ldquo;an intimate knowledge of the <a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>castle of Elsinore,&rdquo; though an
English <i>troupe</i> of actors visited Denmark in 1587.&nbsp; To
Will all this knowledge was <i>impossible</i>; for these and many
more exquisite reasons the yokel&rsquo;s authorship of the plays
is a physical impossibility.&nbsp; But scholars neither invent
nor tolerate such strange liberties with time and place, with
history, geography, and common sense.&nbsp; Will Shakspere either
did not know what was right, or, more probably, did not care, and
supposed, like Fielding in the old anecdote, that the audience
&ldquo;would not find it out.&rdquo;&nbsp; How could a scholar do
any of these things?&nbsp; He was as incapable of them as Ben
Jonson.&nbsp; Such sins no scholar is inclined to; they have, for
him, no temptations.</p>

</a></p>
<p>As to Shakspere&rsquo;s schooling, the Baconians point at the
current ignorance of Stratford-on-Avon, where many topping
burgesses, even aldermen, &ldquo;made their marks,&rdquo; in
place of signing their names to documents.&nbsp;
Shakespeare&rsquo;s father, wife, and daughter &ldquo;made their
marks,&rdquo; in place of signing.&nbsp; So did Lady Jane Gordon,
daughter of the Earl of Huntly, when she married the cultivated
Earl of Bothwell (1566).</p>
<p>There is no evidence, from a roll of schoolboys at Stratford
Free Grammar School, about 1564&ndash;77, that any given boy
attended it; for no roll exists.&nbsp; Consequently there is no
evidence that Will was a pupil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the Appendix to Malone&rsquo;s <i>Life of
Shakespeare</i> will be found two Latin letters, written <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>by alumni of
Stratford School contemporary with Shakespeare,&rdquo; says Mr.
Collins. <a name="citation48a"></a><a href="#footnote48a"
class="citation">[48a]</a>&nbsp; But though the writers were
Stratford boys contemporary with Shakespeare, in later life his
associates, as there is no roll of pupils&rsquo; names how do we
know, the Baconians may ask, that these men were educated at
Stratford School?&nbsp; Why not at Winchester, Eton, St.
Paul&rsquo;s, or anywhere?&nbsp; Need one reply?</p>
<p>Mr. Collins goes on, in his simple confiding way, to state
that &ldquo;one letter is by Abraham Sturley, afterwards an
alderman of Stratford . . . &rdquo;&nbsp; Pursuing the facts, we
find that Sturley wrote in Latin to &ldquo;Richard Quiney,
Shakespeare&rsquo;s friend,&rdquo; who, if he could read
Sturley&rsquo;s letter, could read Latin.&nbsp; Then <i>young</i>
Richard Quiney, apparently aged eleven, wrote in Latin to his
father.&nbsp; If young Richard Quiney be the son of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s friend, Richard Quiney, then, of course, his
Latin at the age of eleven would only prove that, if he were a
schoolboy at Stratford, <i>one</i> Stratford boy could write
Latin in the generation following that of Shakespeare.&nbsp; Thus
may reason the Baconians.</p>
<p>Perhaps, however, we may say that if Stratford boys
contemporary with Shakspere, in his own rank and known to him,
learned Latin, which they retained in manhood, Shakspere, if he
went to school with them, may have done as much.</p>
<p>Concerning the school, a Free Grammar School, <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>we know that
during Shakespeare&rsquo;s boyhood the Mastership was not
disdained by Walter Roche, perhaps a Fellow of what was then the
most progressive College in learning of those at Oxford, namely,
Corpus Christi.&nbsp; That Shakespeare could have been his pupil
is uncertain; the dates are rather difficult.&nbsp; I think it
probable that he was not, and we do not know the qualifications
of the two or three succeeding Masters.</p>
<p>As to the methods of teaching and the books read at Grammar
Schools, abundance of information has been collected.&nbsp; We
know what the use was in one very good school, Ipswich, from
1528; in another in 1611; but as we do not possess any special
information about Stratford School, Mr. Greenwood opposes the
admission of evidence from other academies.&nbsp; A man might
think that, however much the quality of the teaching varied in
various free schools, the nominal curriculum would be fairly
uniform.</p>
<p>As to the teacher, a good endowment would be apt to attract a
capable man.&nbsp; What was the endowment of Stratford
School?&nbsp; It was derived from the bequest of Thomas Jolyffe
(died 1482), a bequest of lands in Stratford and Dodwell, and
before the Reformation the Brethren of the Guild were &ldquo;to
find a priest fit and able in knowledge to teach grammar freely
to all scholars coming to him, taking nothing for their teaching
. . . &rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The Founder&rsquo;s liberal endowment
made it possible to secure an income for the Master by
deed.&nbsp; <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>Under the Reformation, Somerset&rsquo;s Commission found
that the School Master had &pound;10 yearly by patent; the school
was well conducted, and was not confiscated.&rdquo; <a
name="citation50a"></a><a href="#footnote50a"
class="citation">[50a]</a></p>
<p>Baconians can compare the yearly &pound;20 (the salary in
1570&ndash;6, which then went much further than it does now) with
the incomes of other masters of Grammar Schools, and thereby find
out if the Head-Master was very cheap.&nbsp; Mr. Elton (who knew
his subject intimately) calls the provision
&ldquo;liberal.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Head-Master of Westminster had
&pound;20 and a house.</p>
<p>As to the method of teaching, it was colloquial; questions
were asked and answered in Latin.&nbsp; This method, according to
Dr. Rouse of Perse School, brings boys on much more rapidly than
does our current fashion, as may readily be imagined; but experts
vary in opinion.&nbsp; The method, I conceive, should give a
pupil a vocabulary.&nbsp; Lilly&rsquo;s Latin Grammar was
universally used, and was learned by rote, as by George Borrow,
in the last century.&nbsp; See <i>Lavengro</i> for details.&nbsp;
Conversation books, <i>Sententi&aelig; Pueriles</i>, were in use;
with easy books, such as Corderius&rsquo;s <i>Colloquia</i>, and
so on, for boys were taught to <i>speak</i> Latin, the common
language of the educated in Europe.&nbsp; Waifs of the Armada,
Spaniards wrecked on the Irish coast, met &ldquo;a savage who
knew Latin,&rdquo; and thus could converse with him.&nbsp; The
Eclogues of <a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>Mantuanus, a Latin poet of the Renaissance (the
&ldquo;Old Mantuan&rdquo; of <i>Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s
Lost</i>), were used, with Erasmus&rsquo;s <i>Colloquia</i>, and,
says Mr. Collins, &ldquo;such books as Ovid&rsquo;s
Metamorphoses&rdquo; (and other works of his), &ldquo;the
&AElig;neid, selected comedies of Terence and Plautus, and
portions of C&aelig;sar, Sallust, Cicero, and Livy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pro-di-gi-ous!&rdquo; exclaims Mr. Greenwood, <a
name="citation51a"></a><a href="#footnote51a"
class="citation">[51a]</a> referring to what Mr. Collins says
Will had read at school.&nbsp; But precocious Latinity was not
thought &ldquo;prodigious&rdquo; in an age when nothing but Latin
was taught to boys&mdash;not even cricket.&nbsp; Nor is it to be
supposed that every boy read in all of these authors, still less
read all of their works, but these were the works of which
portions were read.&nbsp; It is not prodigious.&nbsp; I myself,
according to my class-master, was &ldquo;a bad and careless
little boy&rdquo; at thirteen, incurably idle, but I well
remember reading in Ovid and C&aelig;sar, and Sallust, while the
rest of my time was devoted to the total neglect of the
mathematics, English &ldquo;as she was taught,&rdquo; History,
and whatsoever else was expected from me.&nbsp;
Shakespeare&rsquo;s time was not thus frittered away; Latin was
all he learned (if he went to school), and, as he was (on my
theory) a very clever, imaginative kind of boy, I can conceive
that he was intensely interested in the stories told by Ovid, and
in Catiline&rsquo;s Conspiracy (thrilling, if you know your
Sallust); and if his interest were once aroused, he would make
rapid progress.&nbsp; My own early <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>hatred of Greek was hissing and
malignant, but as soon as I opened Homer, all was changed.&nbsp;
One was intensely interested!</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood will not, in the matter of books, go beyond Mr.
Halliwell-Phillipps, <a name="citation52a"></a><a
href="#footnote52a" class="citation">[52a]</a>
&ldquo;Lilly&rsquo;s Grammar, and a few classical works chained
to the desks of the free schools.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Collins
himself gives but &ldquo;a few classical books,&rdquo; of which
<i>portions</i> were read.&nbsp; The chains were in all the free
schools, if Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps is right.&nbsp; The chains,
if authentic, do not count as objections.</p>
<p>Here it must be noted that Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s opinion of
Will&rsquo;s knowledge and attainments is not easily to be
ascertained with precision.&nbsp; He sees, of course, that the
pretension of the extreme Baconians&mdash;Will could not even
write his name&mdash;is absurd.&nbsp; If he could not write, he
could not pass as the author.&nbsp; Mr. Greenwood &ldquo;fears
that the arguments&rdquo; (of a most extreme Baconian)
&ldquo;would drive many wandering sheep back to the Stratfordian
fold.&rdquo; <a name="citation52b"></a><a href="#footnote52b"
class="citation">[52b]</a></p>
<p>He has therefore to find a <i>via media</i>, to present, as
the pseudo-author, a Will who possessed neither books nor
manuscripts when he made his Testament; a rustic, bookless Will,
speaking a patois, who could none the less pass himself off as
the author.&nbsp; So &ldquo;I think it highly probable,&rdquo;
says Mr. Greenwood, &ldquo;that he attended <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>the Grammar
School at Stratford for four or five years, and that, later in
life, after some years in London, he was probably able to
&lsquo;bumbast out a line,&rsquo; and perhaps to pose as
&lsquo;Poet-Ape who would be thought our chief.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a
name="citation53a"></a><a href="#footnote53a"
class="citation">[53a]</a>&nbsp; Again, &ldquo;He had had but
little schooling; he had &lsquo;small Latin and less
Greek&rsquo;; but he was a good <i>Johannes Factotum</i>, he
could arrange a scene, and, when necessary, &lsquo;bumbast out a
blank verse.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation53b"></a><a
href="#footnote53b" class="citation">[53b]</a></p>
<p>But this is almost to abandon Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s
case.&nbsp; Will appears to me to be now perilously near
acceptance as Greene&rsquo;s &ldquo;Shake-scene,&rdquo; who was a
formidable rival to Greene&rsquo;s three professional
playwrights: and quite as near to Ben&rsquo;s Poet-Ape
&ldquo;that would be thought our chief,&rdquo; who began by
re-making old plays; then won &ldquo;some little wealth and
credit on the scene,&rdquo; who had his &ldquo;works&rdquo;
printed (for Ben expects them to reach posterity), and whom Ben
accused of plagiarism from himself and his contemporaries.&nbsp;
But this Shake-scene, this Poet-Ape, is merely our Will
Shakespeare as described by bitterly jealous and envious
rivals.&nbsp; Where are now the &ldquo;works&rdquo; of
&ldquo;Poet-Ape&rdquo; if they are not the works of Shakespeare
which Ben so nobly applauded later, if they are not in the blank
verse of Greene&rsquo;s Shake-scene?&nbsp;
&ldquo;Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays&rdquo; we call them.</p>
<p><i>When</i> was it &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; for the
&ldquo;Stratford <a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>rustic&rdquo; to &ldquo;bumbast out a blank
verse&rdquo;?&nbsp; Where are the blank verses which he bumbasted
out?&nbsp; For what purposes were they bumbasted?&nbsp; By 1592
&ldquo;Shake-scene&rdquo; was ambitious, and thought his blank
verse as good as the best that Greene&rsquo;s friends, including
Marlowe, could write.&nbsp; He had plenty of time to practise
before the date when, as Ben wrote, &ldquo;he would be thought
our chief.&rdquo;&nbsp; He would not cease to do that in which he
conceived himself to excel; to write for the stage.</p>
<p>When once Mr. Greenwood deems it &ldquo;highly probable&rdquo;
that Will had four or five years of education at a Latin school,
Will has as much of &ldquo;grounding&rdquo; in Latin, I think, as
would account for all the knowledge of the Roman tongue which he
displays.&nbsp; His amount of teaching at school would carry and
tempt even a boy who was merely clever, and loved to read
romantic tales and comic plays, into Ovid and
Plautus&mdash;English books being to him not very accessible.</p>
<p>Here I may speak from my own memories, for though utterly idle
where set school tasks were concerned, I tried very early to
worry the sense out of Aristophanes&mdash;because he was said to
contain good reading.</p>
<p>To this amount of taste and curiosity, nowise unexampled in an
ordinary clever boy, add <i>Genius</i>, and I feel no difficulty
as to Will&rsquo;s &ldquo;learning,&rdquo; such as, at best, it
was.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Stratfordian,&rdquo; says Mr. Greenwood,
&ldquo;will ingeminate &lsquo;Genius!&nbsp; <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>Genius!&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation55a"></a><a
href="#footnote55a" class="citation">[55a]</a>&nbsp; I <i>do</i>
say &ldquo;Genius,&rdquo; and stand by it.&nbsp; The ordinary
clever boy, in the supposed circumstances, could read and admire
his Ovid (though Shakespeare used cribs also), the man of genius
could write <i>Venus and Adonis</i>.</p>
<p>Had I to maintain the Baconian hypothesis, I would not weigh
heavily on bookless Will&rsquo;s rusticity and patois.&nbsp;
Accepting Ben Jonson&rsquo;s account of his &ldquo;excellent
phantasy, brave notions, and gentle expressions, wherein he
flowed with that facility . . . ,&rdquo; accepting the tradition
of his lively wit; admitting that he had some Latin and
literature, I would find in him a sufficiently plausible mask for
that immense Unknown with a strange taste for furbishing up older
plays.&nbsp; I would merely deny to Will his <i>genius</i>, and
hand <i>that</i> over to Bacon&mdash;or Bungay.&nbsp; Believe me,
Mr. Greenwood, this is your easiest way!&mdash;perhaps this
<i>is</i> your way?&mdash;the plot of the unscrupulous Will, and
of your astute Bungay, might thus more conceivably escape
detection from the pack of envious playwrights.</p>
<p>According to &ldquo;all tradition,&rdquo; says Mr. Greenwood,
Shakespeare was taken from school at the age of thirteen.&nbsp;
Those late long-descended traditions of Shakespeare&rsquo;s youth
are of little value as evidence; but, if it pleases Mr.
Greenwood, I will, for the sake of argument, accept the whole of
them.&nbsp; Assuredly I shall not arbitrarily choose among the
traditions: all depends on the genealogical <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>steps by
which they reach us, as far as these can be discovered. <a
name="citation56a"></a><a href="#footnote56a"
class="citation">[56a]</a></p>
<p>According to the tattle of Aubrey the antiquary, publishing in
1680, an opinion concerning Shakspere&rsquo;s education reached
him.&nbsp; It came thus; there had been an actor in
Shakspere&rsquo;s company, one Phillips, who, dying in 1605, left
to Shakspere the usual thirty-shilling piece of gold; and the
same &ldquo;to my servant, Christopher Beeston.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Christopher&rsquo;s son, William, in 1640, became deputy to
Davenant in the management of &ldquo;the King&rsquo;s and
Queen&rsquo;s Young Company&rdquo;, and through Beeston,
according to Aubrey, Davenant learned; through Beeston Aubrey
learned, that Shakespeare &ldquo;understood Latin pretty well,
for he had been in his younger days a school-master in the
country.&rdquo;&nbsp; Aubrey writes that &ldquo;old Mr. Beeston,
whom Mr. Dryden calls &lsquo;the chronicle of the
stage,&rsquo;&rdquo; died in 1682. <a name="citation56b"></a><a
href="#footnote56b" class="citation">[56b]</a></p>
<p>This is a fair example of the genealogy of the
traditions.&nbsp; Phillips, a friend of Shakspere, dies in 1605,
leaving a servant, Christopher Beeston (he, too, was a
versifier), whose son, William, dies in 1682; he is &ldquo;the
chronicle of the stage.&rdquo;&nbsp; Through him Davenant gets
the story, through him Aubrey gets the story, that Shakspere
&ldquo;knew Latin pretty well,&rdquo; and had been a rural <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>dominie.&nbsp; Mr. Greenwood <a
name="citation57a"></a><a href="#footnote57a"
class="citation">[57a]</a> devotes much space to disparaging
Aubrey (and I do not think him a scientific authority, <i>moult
s&rsquo;en faut</i>), but Mr. Greenwood here says not a word as
to the steps in the descent of the tradition.&nbsp; He frequently
repeats himself, thereby forcing me to more iteration than I
like.&nbsp; He had already disparaged Aubrey in note I to p. 105,
but there he approached so closely to historical method as to say
that &ldquo;Aubrey quotes Beeston, a seventeenth-century actor,
as his authority.&rdquo;&nbsp; On p. 209 he dismisses the
anecdote (which does not suit his book) as &ldquo;a mere
myth.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>He</i> knows, <i>he</i> knows&rdquo;
which traditions are mythical, and which possess a certain
historical value.</p>
<p>My own opinion is that Shakspere did &ldquo;know Latin pretty
well,&rdquo; and was no <i>scholar</i>, as his contemporaries
reckoned scholarship.&nbsp; He left school, if tradition speak
true, by a year later than the age, twelve, when Bacon went to
Cambridge.&nbsp; Will, a clever kind of lad (on my theory), left
school at an age when some other clever lads became
freshmen.&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; Gilbert Burnet (of whom you may
have heard as Bishop of Salisbury under William III) took his
degree at the age of fourteen.</p>
<p>Taking Shakspere as an extremely quick, imaginative boy, with
nothing to learn but Latin, and by the readiest road, the
colloquial, I conceive him to have discovered that, in Ovid
especially, <a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>were to be found the most wonderful and delightful
stories, and poetry which could not but please his &ldquo;green
unknowing youth.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the years before he left
Stratford, and after he left school (1577&ndash;87?), I can
easily suppose that he was not <i>always</i> butchering calves,
poaching, and making love; and that, if he could get books in no
other way, this graceless fellow might be detected on a summer
evening, knitting his brows over the stories and jests of the
chained Ovid and Plautus on his old schoolroom desk.&nbsp; <i>Moi
qui parle</i>, I am no genius; but stories, romance, and humour
would certainly have dragged me back to the old desks&mdash;if
better might not be, and why not Shakspere?&nbsp; Put yourself in
his place, if you have ever been a lad, and if, as a lad, you
liked to steal away into the world of romance, into
fairyland.</p>
<p>If Will wrote the plays, he (and indeed whoever wrote the
plays) was a marvel of genius.&nbsp; But I am not here claiming
for him genius, but merely stating my opinion that if he were
fond of stories and romance, had no English books of poetry and
romance, and had acquired as much power of reading Latin as a
lively, curious boy could easily gain in four years of
exclusively Latin education, he might continue his studies as he
pleased, yet be, so far, no prodigy.</p>
<p>I am contemplating Will in the conditions on which the
Baconians insist; if they will indeed let us assume that for a
few years he was at a <a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>Latin school.&nbsp; I credit the
graceless loon with the curiosity, the prompt acquisitiveness,
the love of poetry and romance, which the author of the plays
must have possessed in youth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tradition says nothing
of all that,&rdquo; the Baconian answers, and he may now, if he
likes, turn to my reply in <i>The Traditional Shakespeare</i>. <a
name="citation59a"></a><a href="#footnote59a"
class="citation">[59a]</a>&nbsp; Meanwhile, how can you expect
old clerks and sextons, a century after date, in a place where
literature was <i>not</i> of supreme interest, to retain a
tradition that Will used to read sometimes (if he did), in
circumstances of privacy?&nbsp; As far as I am able to judge, had
I been a boy at Stratford school for four years, had been taught
nothing but Latin, and had little or no access to English books
of poetry and romance, I should have acquired about the same
amount of Latin as I suppose Shakspere to have possessed.&nbsp;
Yet I could scarcely, like him, have made the second syllable in
&ldquo;Posthumus&rdquo; long!&nbsp; Sir Walter Scott, however,
was guilty of similar false quantities: he and Shakspere were
about equally scholarly.</p>
<p>I suppose, then, that Shakspere&rsquo;s &ldquo;small
Latin&rdquo; (as Jonson called it) enabled him to read in the
works of the Roman clerks; to read sufficient for his uses.&nbsp;
As a fact, he made use of English translations, and also of Latin
texts.&nbsp; Scholars like Bacon do not use bad translations of
easy Latin authors.&nbsp; If Bacon wanted Plutarch, he went to
Plutarch in Greek, not to an English <a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>translation of a French translation
of a Latin translation.</p>
<p>Some works of Shakespeare, the <i>Lucrece</i>, for example,
and <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> (if he were not working over an
earlier canvas from a more learned hand), and other passages,
show knowledge of Latin texts which in his day had not appeared
in published translations, or had not been translated at all as
far as we know.&nbsp; In my opinion Will had Latin enough to
puzzle out the sense of the Latin, never difficult, for
himself.&nbsp; He could also &ldquo;get a construe,&rdquo; when
in London, or help in reading, from a more academic acquaintance:
or buy a construe at no high ransom from some poor scholar.&nbsp;
No contemporary calls him scholarly; the generation of men who
were small boys when he died held him for no scholar.&nbsp; The
current English literature of his day was saturated with every
kind of classical information; its readers, even if Latinless,
knew, or might know a world of lore with which the modern man is
seldom acquainted.&nbsp; The ignorant Baconian marvels: the
classically educated Baconian who is not familiar with
Elizabethan literature is amazed.&nbsp; Really there is nothing
worthy of their wonder.</p>
<p>Does any contemporary literary allusion to Shakespeare call
him &ldquo;<i>learned</i>&rdquo;?&nbsp; He is
&ldquo;sweet,&rdquo; &ldquo;honey-tongued,&rdquo;
&ldquo;mellifluous,&rdquo; and so forth, but I ask for any
contemporary who flattered him with the compliment of
&ldquo;learned.&rdquo;&nbsp; What <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>Ben Jonson thought of his learning
(but Ben&rsquo;s standard was very high), what Milton and Fuller,
boys of eight when he died, thought of his learning, we
know.&nbsp; They thought him &ldquo;Fancy&rsquo;s child&rdquo;
(Milton) and with no claims to scholarship (Fuller), with
&ldquo;small Latin and less Greek&rdquo; (Jonson).&nbsp; They
speak of Shakespeare the author and actor; not yet had any man
divided the persons.</p>
<p>Elizabethan and Jacobean scholarly poets were widely read in
the classics.&nbsp; They were not usually, however, scholars in
the same sense as our modern scholarly poets and men of letters;
such as Mr. Swinburne among the dead, and Mr. Mackail and Sir
Gilbert Murray&mdash;if I may be pardoned for mentioning
contemporary names.&nbsp; But Elizabethan scholarly poets, and
Milton, never regarded Shakespeare as learned.&nbsp; Perhaps few
modern men of letters who are scholars differ from them.&nbsp;
The opinion of Mr. Collins is to be discussed presently, but even
he thought Shakespeare&rsquo;s scholarship &ldquo;inexact,&rdquo;
as we shall see.</p>
<p>I conceive that Shakspere &ldquo;knew Latin pretty
well,&rdquo; and, on Ben Jonson&rsquo;s evidence, he knew
&ldquo;less Greek.&rdquo;&nbsp; That he knew <i>any</i> Greek is
surprising.&nbsp; Apparently he did, to judge from Ben&rsquo;s
words.&nbsp; My attitude must, to the Baconians, seem frivolous,
vexatious, and evasive.&nbsp; I cannot pretend to know what was
Shakspere&rsquo;s precise amount of proficiency in Latin when he
was writing the plays.&nbsp; That between his own knowledge, and
construes given to him, he might easily <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>get at the
meaning of all the Latin, not yet translated, which he certainly
knew, I believe.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood says &ldquo;the amount of reading which the lad
Shakspere must have done, and assimilated, during his brief
sojourn at the Free School is positively amazing.&rdquo; <a
name="citation62a"></a><a href="#footnote62a"
class="citation">[62a]</a>&nbsp; But I have shown how an
imaginative boy, with little or no access to English poetry and
romances, might continue to read Latin &ldquo;for human
pleasure&rdquo; after he left school.&nbsp; As a professional
writer, in a London where Latinists were as common as now they
are rare in literary society, he might read more, and be helped
in his reading.&nbsp; Any clever man might do as much, not to
speak of a man of genius.&nbsp; &ldquo;And yet, alas, there is no
record or tradition of all this prodigious industry. . . .
&rdquo;&nbsp; I am not speaking of &ldquo;prodigious
industry,&rdquo; and of that&mdash;at school.&nbsp; In a region
so non-literary as, by his account, was Stratford, Mr. Greenwood
ought not to expect traditions of Will&rsquo;s early reading
(even if he studied much more deeply than I have supposed) to
exist, from fifty to seventy years after Will was dead, in the
memories of the sons and grandsons of country people who cared
for none of these things.&nbsp; The thing is not reasonable. <a
name="citation62b"></a><a href="#footnote62b"
class="citation">[62b]</a></p>
<p>Let me take one example <a name="citation62c"></a><a
href="#footnote62c" class="citation">[62c]</a> of what Mr. E. A.
Sonnenschein is quoted as saying (somewhere) about
Shakespeare&rsquo;s debt to Seneca&rsquo;s then untranslated <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>paper <i>De
Clementia</i> (1, 3, 3; I, 7, 2; I, 6, I).&nbsp; It inspires
Portia&rsquo;s speech about Mercy.&nbsp; Here I give a version of
the Latin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clemency becometh, of all men, none more than the King
or chief magistrate (<i>principem</i>) . . . No one can think of
anything more becoming to a ruler than clemency . . . which will
be confessed the fairer and more goodly in proportion as it is
exhibited in the higher office . . . But if the placable and just
gods punish not instantly with their thunderbolts the sins of the
powerful, how much more just it is that a man set over men should
gently exercise his power.&nbsp; What?&nbsp; Holds not he the
place nearest to the gods, who, bearing himself like the gods, is
kind, and generous, and uses his power for the better? . .
.&nbsp; Think . . . what a lone desert and waste Rome would be,
were nothing left, and none, save such as a severe judge would
absolve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last sentence is fitted with this parallel in
Portia&rsquo;s speech:</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Consider
this<br />
That in the course of Justice none of us<br />
Should see salvation.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, at least, Protestant theology, not Seneca, inspires
Portia&rsquo;s eloquence.</p>
<p>Now take Portia:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The quality of Mercy is not
strain&rsquo;d;<br />
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven<br />
Upon the place beneath: it is twice blessed;<br />
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Not much Seneca, so far!)</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it
becomes<br />
The thron&egrave;d monarch better than his crown;<br />
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,<br />
The attribute to awe and majesty,<br />
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;<br />
But Mercy is above this sceptred sway,<br />
It is enthron&egrave;d in the hearts of kings,<br />
It is an attribute to God himself;<br />
And earthly power doth then show likest God&rsquo;s,<br />
When mercy seasons justice . . . &rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There follows the passage about none of us seeing salvation,
already cited, and theological in origin.</p>
<p>Whether Shakespeare could or could not have written these
reflections, without having read Seneca&rsquo;s <i>De
Clementia</i>, whether, if he could not conceive the ideas
&ldquo;out of his own head,&rdquo; he might not hear
Seneca&rsquo;s words translated in a sermon, or in conversation,
or read them cited in an English book, each reader must decide
for himself.&nbsp; Nor do I doubt that Shakespeare could pick out
what he wanted from the Latin if he cast his eye over the essay
of the tutor of Nero.</p>
<p>My view of Shakespeare&rsquo;s Latinity is much like that of
Sir Walter Raleigh. <a name="citation64a"></a><a
href="#footnote64a" class="citation">[64a]</a>&nbsp; As far as I
am aware, it is the opinion usually held by people who approach
the subject, and who have had a classical education.&nbsp; An
exception was the late Mr. Churton Collins, whose ideas are
discussed in the following chapter.</p>
<p>In his youth, and in the country, Will could <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>do what Hogg
and Burns did (and Hogg had no education at all; he was
self-taught, even in writing).&nbsp; Will could pick up
traditional, oral, popular literature.&nbsp; &ldquo;His
plays,&rdquo; says Sir Walter Raleigh, &ldquo;are extraordinarily
rich in the floating debris of popular literature,&mdash;scraps
and tags and broken ends of songs and ballads and romances and
proverbs.&nbsp; In this respect he is notable even among his
contemporaries. . . .&nbsp; Edgar and Iago, Petruchio and
Benedick, Sir Toby and Pistol, the Fool in <i>Lear</i> and the
Grave-digger in <i>Hamlet</i>, even Ophelia and Desdemona, are
all alike singers of old songs. . . . &rdquo; <a
name="citation65a"></a><a href="#footnote65a"
class="citation">[65a]</a>&nbsp; He is rich in rural proverbs
<i>not</i> recorded in Bacon&rsquo;s <i>Promus</i>.</p>
<p>Shakespeare in the country, like Scott in Liddesdale,
&ldquo;was making himself all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Baconian will exclaim that Bacon was familiar with many
now obsolete rural words.&nbsp; Bacon, too, may have had a memory
rich in all the tags of song, ballad, story, and
<i>dicton</i>.&nbsp; But so may Shakespeare.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">MR. COLLINS ON SHAKESPEARE&rsquo;S
LEARNING</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">That</span> Shakspere, whether
&ldquo;scholar&rdquo; or not, had a very wide and deep knowledge
both of Roman literature and, still more, of the whole field of
the tragic literature of Athens, is a theory which Mr. Greenwood
seems to admire in that &ldquo;violent Stratfordian,&rdquo; Mr.
Churton Collins. <a name="citation69a"></a><a href="#footnote69a"
class="citation">[69a]</a>&nbsp; I think that Mr. Collins did not
persuade classical scholars who have never given a thought to the
Baconian belief, but who consider on their merits the questions:
Does Shakespeare show wide classical knowledge?&nbsp; Does he use
his knowledge as a scholar would use it?</p>
<p>My friend, Mr. Collins, as I may have to say again, was a very
wide reader of poetry, with a memory like Macaulay&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
It was his native tendency to find coincidences in poetic
passages (which, to some, to me for example, did not often seem
coincidental); and to explain coincidences by conscious or
subconscious borrowing.&nbsp; One remarked in him these
tendencies long before he wrote on the classical acquirements of
Shakespeare.</p>
<p><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>While
Mr. Collins tended to account for similarities in the work of
authors by borrowing, my tendency was to explain them as
undesigned coincidences.&nbsp; The question is of the widest
range.&nbsp; Some inquirers explain the often minute coincidences
in myths, popular tales, proverbs, and riddles, found all over
the world, by diffusion from a single centre (usually
India).&nbsp; Others, like myself, do not deny cases of
transmission, but in other cases see spontaneous and independent,
though coincident invention.&nbsp; I do not believe that the
Arunta of Central Australia borrowed from Plutarch the central
feature of the myth of Isis and Osiris.</p>
<p>It is not on Shakespeare&rsquo;s use, now and then, of Greek
and Latin models and sources, but on coincidences detected by Mr.
Collins himself, and not earlier remarked, that he bases his
belief in the saturation of Shakespeare&rsquo;s mind with Roman
and Athenian literature.&nbsp; Consequently we can only do
justice to Mr. Collins&rsquo;s system, if we compare example
after example of his supposed instances of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
borrowing.&nbsp; This is a long and irksome task; and the only
fair plan is for the reader to peruse Mr. Collins&rsquo;s
<i>Studies in Shakespeare</i>, compare the Greek and Roman texts,
and weigh each example of supposed borrowing for himself.&nbsp;
Baconians must delight in this labour.</p>
<p>I shall waive the question whether it were not possible for
Shakespeare to obtain a view of the <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>manuscript translation of plays of
Plautus made by Warner for his unlearned friends, and so to use
the <i>Men&aelig;chmi</i> as the model of <i>The Comedy of
Errors</i>.&nbsp; He does not borrow phrases from it, as he does
from North&rsquo;s <i>Plutarch</i>.</p>
<p><i>Venus and Adonis</i> owes to Ovid, at most, but ideas for
three purple patches, scattered in different parts of the
<i>Metamorphoses</i>.&nbsp; <i>Lucrece</i> is based on the then
untranslated <i>Fasti</i> of Ovid.&nbsp; I do not think
Shakespeare incapable of reading such easy Latin for himself; or
too proud to ask help from a friend, or buy it from some poor
young University man in London.&nbsp; That is a simple and
natural means by which he could help himself when in search of a
subject for a play or poem; and ought not to be overlooked.</p>
<p>Mr. Collins, in his rapturous account of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
wide and profound knowledge of the classics, opens with the
remark: &ldquo;Nothing which Shakespeare has left us warrants us
in pronouncing with certainty that he read the Greek classics in
the original, or even that he possessed enough Greek to follow
the Latin versions of those classics in the Greek text.&rdquo; <a
name="citation71a"></a><a href="#footnote71a"
class="citation">[71a]</a>&nbsp; In that case, how did
Shakespeare&rsquo;s English become contaminated, as Mr. Collins
says it did, with Greek <i>idioms</i>, while he only knew the
Greek plays through Latin translations?</p>
<p>However this is to be answered, Mr. Collins proceeds to prove
Shakespeare&rsquo;s close familiarity <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>with Latin and with Greek dramatic
literature by a method of which he knows the
perils&mdash;&ldquo;it is always perilous to infer direct
imitation from parallel passages which may be mere
coincidences.&rdquo; <a name="citation72a"></a><a
href="#footnote72a" class="citation">[72a]</a>&nbsp; Yet this
method is what he practises throughout; with what amount of
success every reader must judge for himself.</p>
<p>He thinks it &ldquo;surely not unlikely&rdquo; that
Polonius&rsquo;s</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Neither a borrower nor a lender be:<br />
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>may be a terse reminiscence of seven lines in Plautus
(<i>Trinummus</i>, iv. 3).&nbsp; Why, Polonius is a coiner of
commonplaces, and if ever there were a well-known reflection from
experience it is this of the borrowers and lenders.</p>
<p>Next, take this of Plautus (<i>Pseudolus</i>, I, iv.
7&ndash;10), &ldquo;But just as the poet when he has taken up his
tablets seeks what exists nowhere among men, and yet finds it,
and makes that like truth which is mere fiction.&rdquo;&nbsp; We
are to take this as the possible germ of Theseus&rsquo;s theory
of the origin of the belief in fairies:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And as imagination bodies forth<br />
The <i>forms</i> of things unknown, the poet&rsquo;s pen<br />
Turns them to <i>shapes</i>, and gives to airy nothing<br />
A local habitation and a name.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reasoning is odd; imagination bodies forth <i>forms</i>,
and the poet&rsquo;s pen turns them to <a name="page73"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 73</span><i>shapes</i>.&nbsp; But to suppose
that Shakespeare here borrowed from Plautus appears highly
superfluous.</p>
<p>These are samples of Mr. Collins&rsquo;s methods
throughout.</p>
<p>Of Terence there were translations&mdash;first in part; later,
in 1598, of the whole.&nbsp; Of Seneca there was an English
version (1581).&nbsp; Mr. Collins labours to show that one
passage &ldquo;almost certainly&rdquo; implies
Shakespeare&rsquo;s use of the Latin; but it was used &ldquo;by
an inexact scholar,&rdquo;&mdash;a terribly inexact scholar, if
he thought that &ldquo;<i>alienus</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;what belongs
to another&rdquo;) meant &ldquo;slippery&rdquo;!</p>
<p>Most of the passages are from plays (<i>Titus Andronicus</i>
and <i>Henry VI</i>, i., ii., iii.), which Mr. Greenwood denies
(usually) to <i>his</i> author, the Great Unknown.&nbsp;
Throughout these early plays Mr. Collins takes
Shakespeare&rsquo;s to resemble Seneca&rsquo;s <i>Latin</i>
style: Shakespeare, then, took up Greek tragedy in later life;
after the early period when he dealt with Seneca.&nbsp; Here is a
sample of borrowing from Horace, &ldquo;<i>Persicos odi puer
apparatus</i>&rdquo; (<i>Odes</i>. I, xxxviii. I).&nbsp; Mr.
Collins quotes <i>Lear</i> (III, vi. 85) thus, &ldquo;You will
say they are <i>Persian attire</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Really, Lear in
his wild way says to Edgar, &ldquo;I do not like the fashion of
your garments: you will say they are Persian; but let them be
changed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Collins changes this into &ldquo;you
will say they are <i>Persian attire</i>,&rdquo; a phrase
&ldquo;which could only have occurred to a <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>classical
scholar.&rdquo;&nbsp; The phrase is not in Shakespeare, and
Lear&rsquo;s wandering mind might as easily select
&ldquo;Persian&rdquo; as any other absurdity.</p>
<p>So it is throughout.&nbsp; Two great poets write on the fear
of death, on the cries of new-born children, on dissolution and
recombination in nature, on old age; they have ideas in common,
obvious ideas, glorified by poetry,&mdash;and Shakespeare, we are
told, is borrowing from Lucretius or Juvenal; while the critic
leaves his reader to find out and study the Latin passages which
he does not quote.&nbsp; So arbitrary is taste in these matters
that Mr. Collins, like Mr. Grant White, but independently, finds
Shakespeare putting a thought from the <i>Alcibiades I</i> of
Plato into the mouth of Achilles in <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>,
while Mr. J. M. Robertson suggests that the borrowing is from
Seneca&mdash;where Mr. Collins does not find &ldquo;the smallest
parallel.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Collins is certainly right; the author
of <i>Troilus</i> makes Ulysses quote Plato as &ldquo;the
author&rdquo; of a remark, and makes Achilles take up the
quotation, which Ulysses goes on to criticise.</p>
<p>Thus, in this play, not only Aristotle (as Hector says) but
Plato are taken to have lived before the Trojan war, and to have
been read by the Ach&aelig;ans!</p>
<p>There were Latin translations of Plato; the <i>Alcibiades
I</i> was published apart, from Ficinus&rsquo; version, in 1560,
with the sub-title, <i>Concerning the Nature of Man</i>.&nbsp;
Who had read it?&mdash;Shakespeare, <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>or one of the two authors (Dekker and
Chettle) of another <i>Troilus and Cressida</i> (now lost), or
Bacon, or Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s Unknown?&nbsp; Which of these
Platonists chose to say that Plato and Aristotle lived long
before Homer?&nbsp; Which of them followed the Ionic and
medi&aelig;val anti-Ach&aelig;an view of Homer&rsquo;s heroes, as
given in the Troy Books of the Middle Ages, and yet knew Iliad,
Book VII, and admired Odysseus, whom the Ionian tradition
abhors?&nbsp; <i>Troilus and Cressida</i> is indeed a mystery,
but Somebody concerned in it had read Ficinus&rsquo; version of
the <i>Alcibiades</i>; <a name="citation75a"></a><a
href="#footnote75a" class="citation">[75a]</a> and yet made the
monstrous anachronism of dating Aristotle and Plato before the
Trojan war.&nbsp; &ldquo;That was his fun,&rdquo; as Charles Lamb
said in another connection.</p>
<p>Mr. Collins, it is plain, goes much further than the
&ldquo;small Latin&rdquo; with which his age (like myself)
credited Shakespeare.&nbsp; He could read Latin, Mr. Collins
thinks, as easily as an educated Briton reads French&mdash;that
is, as easily as he reads English.&nbsp; Still further,
Shakespeare, through Latin translations, was so saturated with
the Greek drama &ldquo;that the characteristics which
differentiate his work from the work of his contemporaries and
recall in essentials the work of the Greek dramatists are
actually attributable to these dramatists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ben Jonson, and all the more or less well-taught University
wits, as far as I remember, <a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>like Greene, Marlowe, and Lyly, do
not show much acquaintance with Euripides, &AElig;schylus,
Sophocles, and do not often remind us of these masters.&nbsp;
Shakespeare does remind us of them&mdash;the only question is, do
the resemblances arise from his possession of a genius akin to
that of Greece, or was his memory so stored with all the
treasures of their art that the waters of Helicon kept bubbling
up through the wells of Avon?</p>
<p>But does Mr. Collins prove (what, as he admits, <i>cannot</i>
be demonstrated) that Shakespeare was familiar with the Attic
tragedians?&nbsp; He begins by saying that he will not bottom his
case &ldquo;on the ground of parallels in sentiment and
reflection, which, as they express commonplaces, are likely to
be&rdquo; (fortuitous) &ldquo;coincidences.&rdquo;&nbsp; Three
pages of such parallels, all from Sophocles, therefore
follow.&nbsp; &ldquo;Curiously close similarities of
expression&rdquo; are also barred.&nbsp; Four pages of examples
therefore follow, from Sophocles and &AElig;schylus, plays and
fragments, Euripides, and Homer too (once!).&nbsp; Again,
&ldquo;identities of sentiment under similar circumstances&rdquo;
are not to be cited; two pages <i>are</i> cited; and
&ldquo;similarities, however striking they may be in metaphorical
expression,&rdquo; cannot safely be used; several pages of them
follow.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Collins chooses a single play, the <i>Aias</i> of
Sophocles, and tests Shakespeare by that, unluckily in part from
<i>Titus Andronicus</i>, which Mr. Greenwood regards (usually) as
non-Shakespearean, <a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>or not by his unknown great author.&nbsp; <i>Troilus and
Cressida</i>, whatever part Shakespeare may have had in it, does
suggest to me that the author or authors knew of Homer no more
than the few books of the Iliad, first translated by Chapman and
published in 1598.&nbsp; But he or they did know the <i>Aias</i>
of Sophocles, according to Mr. Collins: so did the author of
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i>.</p>
<p>Now all these sorts of parallels between Shakespeare and the
Greeks are, Mr. Collins tells us, not to count as proofs that
Shakespeare knew the Greek tragedians.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have
obviously to be on our guard&rdquo; <a name="citation77a"></a><a
href="#footnote77a" class="citation">[77a]</a> against three
kinds of such parallels, which &ldquo;may be mere
coincidences,&rdquo; <a name="citation77b"></a><a
href="#footnote77b" class="citation">[77b]</a> fortuitous
coincidences.&nbsp; But these coincidences against which
&ldquo;we must be on our guard&rdquo; fill sixteen pages (pp.
46&ndash;63).&nbsp; These pages must necessarily produce a
considerable effect in the way of persuading the reader that
Shakespeare knew the Greek tragedians as intimately as Mr.
Collins did.&nbsp; Mr. Greenwood is obliged to leave these
parallels to readers of Mr. Collins&rsquo;s essay.&nbsp; Indeed,
what more can we do?&nbsp; Who would read through a criticism of
each instance?&nbsp; Two or three may be given.&nbsp; The Queen
in <i>Hamlet</i> reminds that prince, grieving for his
father&rsquo;s death, that &ldquo;all that live must
die&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That loss is common to the race,<br />
And common is the common-place.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>The
Greek Chorus offers the commonplace to Electra,&mdash;and here is
a parallel!&nbsp; Again, two Greeks agree with Shakespeare that
anxious expectation of evil is worse than actual experience
thereof.&nbsp; Greece agrees with Shakespeare that ill-gotten
gains do not thrive, or that it is not lucky to be &ldquo;a corby
messenger&rdquo; of bad news; or that all goes ill when a man
acts against his better nature; or that we suffer most from the
harm which we bring on ourselves; or that there is strength in a
righteous cause; or that blood calls for blood (an idea common to
Semites, Greeks, and English readers of the Bible); or that,
having lost a very good man, you will not soon see his like
again,&mdash;and so on as long as you please.&nbsp; Of such
wisdom are proverbs made, and savages and Europeans have many
parallel proverbs.&nbsp; <i>Vestigia nulla retrorsum</i> is as
well known to Bushmen as to Latinists.&nbsp; Manifestly nothing
in this kind proves, or even suggests, that Shakespeare was
saturated in Greek tragedy.&nbsp; But page on page of such facts
as that both Shakespeare and Sophocles talk, one of &ldquo;the
belly-pinched wolf,&rdquo; the other of &ldquo;the empty-bellied
wolf,&rdquo; are apt to impress the reader&mdash;and verily both
Shakespeare and &AElig;schylus talk of &ldquo;the heart dancing
for joy.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Collins repeats that such things are no
proof, but he keeps on piling them up.&nbsp; It was a theory of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s time that the apparent ghost of a dead man
might be an impersonation <a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>of him by the devil.&nbsp; Hamlet
knows this&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The spirit that I have seen may be the
devil.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Orestes (<i>Electra</i>, Euripides) asks whether it may not be
an avenging d&aelig;mon (<i>alastor</i>) in the shape of a god,
that bids him avenge his father.&nbsp; Is Shakespeare borrowing
from Euripides, or from a sermon, or any contemporary work on
ghosts, such as that of Lavater?</p>
<p>A girl dies or is sacrificed before her marriage, and
characters in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, and in Euripides, both say
that Death is her bridegroom.&nbsp; Anyone might say that,
anywhere, as in the Greek Anthology&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;For Death not for Love hast thou loosened
thy zone.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One needs the space of a book wherein to consider such
parallels.&nbsp; But confessedly, though a parade is made of
them, they do not prove that Shakespeare constantly read Greek
tragedies in Latin translations.</p>
<p>To let the truth out, the resemblances are mainly found in
such commonplaces: as when both Aias and Antony address the Sun
of their latest day in life; or when John of Gaunt and Aias both
pun on their own names.</p>
<p>The situations, in <i>Hamlet</i> and the
<i>Choephor&aelig;</i> and <i>Electra</i>, are so close that
resemblances in some passages must and do occur, and Mr. Collins
does not comment specially upon the closest resemblance of all:
the English case is here the murder of Duncan, the Greek is the
murder of Agamemnon.</p>
<p><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>Now it
would be easy for me to bring forward many close parallels
between Homer and the old Irish epic story of Cuchulainn, between
Homer and <i>Beowulf</i> and the Njal&rsquo;s saga, yet Norsemen
and the early Irish were not students of Homer!&nbsp; The
parallel passages in Homer, on one side, and the Old Irish
<i>Tain Bo Cualgne</i>, and the Anglo-Saxon epics, are so
numerous and close that the theory of borrowing from Homer has
actually occurred to a distinguished Greek scholar.&nbsp; But no
student of Irish and Anglo-Saxon heroic poetry has been found, I
think, to suggest that Early Irish and Anglo-Saxon Court
minstrels knew Greek.&nbsp; The curious may consult Mr. Munro
Chadwick&rsquo;s <i>The Heroic Age</i> (1912), especially Chapter
XV, &ldquo;The Common Characteristics of Teutonic and Greek
Heroic Poetry,&rdquo; and to what Mr. Chadwick says much might be
added.</p>
<p>But, to be short, Mr. Collins&rsquo;s case can only be judged
by readers of his most interesting <i>Studies in
Shakespeare</i>.&nbsp; To me, Hamlet&rsquo;s soliloquy on death
resembles a fragment from the <i>Ph&oelig;nix</i> of Euripides no
more closely than two sets of reflections by great poets on the
text that &ldquo;of death we know nothing&rdquo; are bound to
do,&mdash;though Shakespeare&rsquo;s are infinitely the
richer.&nbsp; For Shakespeare&rsquo;s reflections on death, save
where Christians die in a Christian spirit, are as agnostic as
those of the post-&AElig;schylean Greek and early Anglo-Saxon
poets.&nbsp; In many respects, as Mr. Collins proves,
Shakespeare&rsquo;s highest and deepest <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>musings are
Greek in tone.&nbsp; But of all English poets he who came nearest
to Greece in his art was Keats, who of Greek knew nothing.&nbsp;
In the same way, a peculiar vein of Anglo-Saxon thought, in
relation to Destiny and Death, is purely Homeric, though
necessarily unborrowed; nor were a native Fijian poet&rsquo;s
lines on old age, <i>sine amore jocisque</i>, borrowed from
Mimnermus!&nbsp; There is such a thing as congruity of
genius.&nbsp; Mr. Collins states the hypothesis&mdash;not his
own&mdash;&ldquo;that <i>by a certain natural affinity</i>
Shakespeare caught also the accent and tone as well as some of
the most striking characteristics of Greek tragedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though far from accepting most of Mr. Collins&rsquo;s long
array of Greek parallels, I do hold that by &ldquo;natural
affinity,&rdquo; by congruity of genius, Shakespeare approached
and resembled the great Athenians.</p>
<p>One thing seems certain to me.&nbsp; If Shakspere read and
borrowed from Greek poetry, he knew it as well (except Homer) as
Mr. Collins knew it; and remembered what he knew with Mr.
Collins&rsquo;s extraordinary tenacity of memory.</p>
<p>Now if &ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo; did all that, he was not the
actor.&nbsp; The author, on Mr. Collins&rsquo;s showing, must
have been a very sedulous and diligent student of Greek poetry,
above all of the drama, down to its fragments.&nbsp; The
Baconians assuredly ought to try to prove, from Bacon&rsquo;s
works, that he was such a student.</p>
<p>Mr. Collins, &ldquo;a violent Stratfordian,&rdquo; overproved
<a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>his
case.&nbsp; If his proofs be accepted, Shakspere the actor knew
the Greek tragedians as well as did Mr. Swinburne.&nbsp; If the
author of the plays were so learned, the actor was not the
author, in my opinion&mdash;he <i>was</i>, in the opinion of Mr.
Collins.</p>
<p>If Shakespeare&rsquo;s spirit and those of Sophocles and
&AElig;schylus meet, it is because they move on the same heights,
and thence survey with &ldquo;the poet&rsquo;s sad
lucidity&rdquo; the same &ldquo;pageant of men&rsquo;s
miseries.&rdquo;&nbsp; But how dissimilar in expression
Shakespeare can be, how luxuriant and apart from the austerity of
Greece, we observe in one of Mr. Collins&rsquo;s parallels.</p>
<p>Polynices, in the <i>Ph&oelig;niss&aelig;</i> of Euripides
(504&ndash;506), exclaims:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To the stars&rsquo; risings, and the
sun&rsquo;s I&rsquo;d go,<br />
And dive &rsquo;neath earth,&mdash;if I could do this
thing,&mdash;<br />
Possess Heaven&rsquo;s highest boon of sovereignty.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then compare Hotspur:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;By Heaven, methinks it were an easy leap<br
/>
To pluck bright honour from the pale faced moon,<br />
Or dive into the bottom of the deep,<br />
Where fathom-line could never touch the ground,<br />
And pluck up drown&egrave;d honour by the locks,<br />
So he that doth redeem her thence, might wear<br />
Without corrival all her dignities.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What a hurrying crowd of pictures rush through Hotspur&rsquo;s
mind!&nbsp; Is Shakespeare thinking of the
<i>Ph&oelig;niss&aelig;</i>, or is he speaking only on the
promptings of his genius?</p>
<h2><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>V<br
/>
<span class="GutSmall">SHAKESPEARE, GENIUS, AND
SOCIETY</span></h2>
<p>A <span class="smcap">phrase</span> has been used to explain
the Greek element in Shakespeare&rsquo;s work, namely,
&ldquo;congruity of genius,&rdquo; which is apt to be resented by
Baconians.&nbsp; Perhaps they have a right to resent it, for
&ldquo;genius&rdquo; is hard to define, and genius is invoked by
some wild wits to explain feats of Shakespeare&rsquo;s which (to
Baconians) appear &ldquo;miracles.&rdquo;&nbsp; A
&ldquo;miracle&rdquo; also is notoriously hard to define; but we
may take it (&ldquo;under all reserves&rdquo;) to stand for the
occurrence of an event, or the performance of an action which, to
the speaker who applies the word &ldquo;miracle,&rdquo; seems
&ldquo;impossible.&rdquo;&nbsp; The speaker therefore says,
&ldquo;The event is impossible; miracles do not happen: therefore
the reported event never occurred.&nbsp; The alleged performance,
the writing of the plays by the actor, was impossible, was a
miracle, therefore was done by some person or persons other than
the actor.&rdquo;&nbsp; This idea of the <i>impossibility</i> of
the player&rsquo;s authorship is the foundation of the Baconian
edifice.</p>
<p>I have, to the best of my ability, tried to describe Mr.
Greenwood&rsquo;s view of the young provincial from Warwickshire,
Will Shakspere.&nbsp; If <a name="page86"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>Will were what Mr. Greenwood thinks
he was, then Will&rsquo;s authorship of the plays seems to me,
&ldquo;humanly speaking,&rdquo; impossible.&nbsp; But then Mr.
Greenwood appeared to omit from his calculations the circumstance
that Will <i>may</i> have been, not merely &ldquo;a sharp
boy&rdquo; but a boy of great parts; and not without a love of
stories and poetry: a passion which, in a bookless region, could
only be gratified through folk-song, folk-tale, and such easy
Latin as he might take the trouble to read.&nbsp; If we add to
these very unusual but not wholly impossible tastes and
abilities, that Will <i>may</i> have been a lad of genius, there
is no more &ldquo;miracle&rdquo; in his case than in other
supreme examples of genius.&nbsp; &ldquo;But genius cannot work
miracles, cannot do what is impossible.&rdquo;&nbsp; Do what is
impossible to whom?&nbsp; To the critics, the men of common
sense.</p>
<p>Alas, all this way of talking about &ldquo;miracles,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;the impossible,&rdquo; and &ldquo;genius&rdquo; is
quite vague and popular.&nbsp; What do we mean by
&ldquo;genius&rdquo;?&nbsp; The Latin term originally designates,
not a man&rsquo;s everyday intellect, but a spirit from without
which inspires him, like the &ldquo;D&aelig;mon,&rdquo; or, in
Latin, &ldquo;Genius&rdquo; of Socrates, or the <i>lutin</i>
which rode the pen of Moli&egrave;re.&nbsp; &ldquo;Genius&rdquo;
is claimed for Shakespeare in an inscription on his Stratford
monument, erected at latest some six years after his death.&nbsp;
Following this path of thought we come to
&ldquo;inspiration&rdquo;: the notion of it, as familiar to
Australian savages as to any <a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>modern minds, is that, to the poet,
what he produces is <i>given</i> by some power greater than
himself, by the <i>Boilyas</i> (spirits) or Pundjel, the Father
of all.&nbsp; This pal&aelig;olithic psychology, of course, is
now quite discredited, yet the term &ldquo;genius&rdquo; is still
(perhaps superstitiously) applied to the rare persons whose
intellectual faculties lightly outrun those of ordinary mortals,
and who do marvels with means apparently inadequate.</p>
<p>In recent times some philosophers, like Mr. F. W. H. Myers,
put&mdash;in place of the Muses or the <i>Boilyas</i>, or the
Genius&mdash;what they call the &ldquo;Subliminal Self,&rdquo;
something &ldquo;far more deeply interfused than the everyday
intellect.&rdquo;&nbsp; This subconscious self, capable of far
more than the conscious intelligence, is genius.</p>
<p>On the other side, genius may fairly be regarded as faculty,
only higher in degree, and not at all different in kind, from the
everyday intellect which, for example, pens this page.</p>
<p>Thus as soon as we begin to speak of &ldquo;genius,&rdquo; we
are involved in speculations, psychological, psychical, physical,
and metaphysical; in difficulties of all sorts not at present to
be solved either by physiological science or experimental
psychology, or by psychical research, or by the study of
heredity.&nbsp; When I speak of &ldquo;the genius of
Shakespeare,&rdquo; of Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc, of Bacon, even of
Wellington, I possibly have a meaning which is not in all
respects the meaning of Mr. Greenwood, when he uses the term
&ldquo;genius&rdquo;; <a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>so we are apt to misunderstand each
other.&nbsp; Yet we all glibly use the term &ldquo;genius,&rdquo;
without definition and without discussion.</p>
<p>At once, too, in this quest, we jostle against &ldquo;that
fool of a word,&rdquo; as Napoleon said,
&ldquo;impossible.&rdquo;&nbsp; At once, on either side, we
assume that we know what is possible and what is
impossible,&mdash;and so pretend to omniscience.</p>
<p>Thus some &ldquo;Stratfordians,&rdquo; or defenders of the
actor&rsquo;s authorship, profess to know&mdash;from all the
signed work of Bacon, and from all that has reached us about
Bacon&rsquo;s occupations and preoccupations, from 1590 to
1605&mdash;that the theory of Bacon&rsquo;s authorship of the
plays is &ldquo;impossible.&rdquo;&nbsp; I, however, do not
profess this omniscience.</p>
<p>On the other side the Baconian, arguing from all that
<i>he</i> knows, or thinks he knows, or can imagine, of the
actor&rsquo;s education, conditions of life, and opportunities,
argues that the authorship of the actor is
&ldquo;impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both sides assume to be omniscient, but we incontestably know
much more about Bacon, in his works, his aims, his inclinations,
and in his life, than we know about the actor; while about
&ldquo;the potentialities of genius,&rdquo; we know&mdash;very
little.</p>
<p>Thus, with all Bacon&rsquo;s occupations and preoccupations,
he had, the Baconians will allow, <i>genius</i>.&nbsp; By the
miracle of genius he <i>may</i> have found time and developed
inclination, to begin by furbishing up older plays for a company
of <a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>actors:
he did it extremely well, but what a quaint taste for a courtier
and scholar!&nbsp; The eccentricities of genius <i>may</i>
account for his choice of a &ldquo;<i>nom de plume</i>,&rdquo;
which, if he desired concealment, was the last that was likely to
serve his turn.&nbsp; He may also have divined all the Doll
Tearsheets and Mrs. Quicklys and Pistols, whom, conceivably, he
did not much frequent.</p>
<p>I am not one of those who deny that Bacon might have written
<i>Hamlet</i> &ldquo;if he had the mind,&rdquo; as Charles Lamb
said of Wordsworth.&nbsp; Not at all; I am the last to limit the
potentialities of genius.</p>
<p>But suppose, merely for the sake of argument, that Will
Shakspere too had genius in that amazing degree which, in
<i>Henry V</i>, the Bishop of Ely and the Archbishop of
Canterbury describe and discuss in the case of the young
king.&nbsp; In this passage we perceive that the poet had brooded
over and been puzzled by the &ldquo;miracle&rdquo; (he uses the
word) of genius.&nbsp; Says Canterbury speaking of the
Prince&rsquo;s wild youth,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Never was such a sudden scholar
made.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One Baconian objection to Shakespeare&rsquo;s authorship is
that during his early years in London (say 1587&ndash;92) he was
&ldquo;such a sudden scholar made&rdquo; in various things.</p>
<p>The young king&rsquo;s</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;addiction was to courses
vain,<br />
His companies unletter&rsquo;d, rude, and shallow,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>precisely like Shakespeare&rsquo;s courses and
companions at Stratford</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Had never noted in him any
study.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stratford tradition, a century after Shakespeare left the
town, did not remember &ldquo;any study&rdquo; in him; none had
been &ldquo;noted,&rdquo; nor could have been remembered.&nbsp;
To return to Henry, he shines in divinity, knowledge of
&ldquo;commonwealth affairs,&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You would say, it hath been all in all his
study.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He is as intimate with the art of war; to him &ldquo;Gordian
knots of policy&rdquo; are &ldquo;familiar as his
garter.&rdquo;&nbsp; He <i>must</i> have</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The art and practic part of
life,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>as &ldquo;mistress to this theorie,&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Which is a wonder how his Grace should
glean it,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>as his youth was riotous, and was lived in all men&rsquo;s
gaze,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And never noted in him any study,<br />
Any retirement, any sequestration<br />
From open haunts and popularity.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bishop of Ely can only suggest that Henry&rsquo;s study or
&ldquo;contemplation&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Grew like the summer grass, fastest by
night,<br />
Unseen,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and Canterbury says</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It must be so, for miracles are
ceased.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>And
thus the miracle of genius baffles the poet, for Henry&rsquo;s
had been &ldquo;noisy nights,&rdquo; notoriously noisy.</p>
<p>Now, as we shall later show, Bacon&rsquo;s rapid production of
the plays, considering his other contemporary activities and
varied but always absorbing interests, was as much a miracle as
the sudden blossoming of Henry&rsquo;s knowledge and
accomplishments; for all Bacon&rsquo;s known exertions and
occupations, and his deepest and most absorbing interest, were
remote from the art of tragedy and comedy.&nbsp; If we are to
admit the marvel of genius in Bacon, of whose life and pursuits
we know much, by parity of reasoning we may grant that the actor,
of whom we know much less, may have had genius: had powers and
could use opportunities in a way for which Baconians make no
allowance.</p>
<p>We now turn to Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s chapter,
&ldquo;Shakespeare and &lsquo;Genius.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; It
opens with the accustomed list of poor Will&rsquo;s

(date unknown) &ldquo;a needy adventurer&rdquo;; in 1593 appeared
the poem <i>Venus and Adonis</i>, author&rsquo;s name being
printed as &ldquo;W. Shakespeare.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then comes
<i>Lucrece</i> (1594).&nbsp; In 1598 <i>Love&rsquo;s
Labour&rsquo;s Lost</i>, printed as &ldquo;corrected and
augmented&rdquo; by &ldquo;W. Shakespere.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so on
with all the rest.&nbsp; Criticism of the learning and splendour
of the two <a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>poems follows.&nbsp; To <i>Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s
Lost</i>, and the amusing things written about it by Baconians, I
return; and to Shakespeare&rsquo;s &ldquo;impossible&rdquo;
knowledge of courtly society, his &ldquo;polish and
urbanity,&rdquo; his familiar acquaintance with contemporary
French politics, foreign proverbs, and &ldquo;the gossip of the
Court&rdquo; of Elizabeth: these points are made by His Honour
Judge Webb.</p>
<p>All this lore to Shakespeare is
&ldquo;impossible&rdquo;&mdash;he could not read, say some
Baconians, or had no Latin, or had next to none; on these points
I have said my say.&nbsp; The omniscient Baconians know that all
the early works ascribed to the actor were impossible, to a man
of, say thirty&mdash;who <i>was</i> no more, and <i>knew</i> no
more, than they know that the actor was and knew; and as for
&ldquo;Genius,&rdquo; it cannot work miracles.&nbsp; Genius
&ldquo;bestows upon no one a knowledge of facts,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Shakespeare, however favoured by nature, could impart only
what he had learned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Precisely, but genius as I understand it (and even cleverness)
has a way of acquiring knowledge of facts where the ordinary
&ldquo;dull intelligent man&rdquo; gains none.&nbsp; Keen
interest, keen curiosity, swift observation, even the power of
tearing out the things essential from a book, the gift of rapid
reading; the faculty of being alive to the
fingertips,&mdash;these, with a tenacious memory, may enable a
small boy to know more facts of many sorts than his elders and
betters and all the neighbours.&nbsp; They are puzzled, if they
make the <a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>discovery of his knowledge.&nbsp; Scott was such a small
boy; whether we think him a man of genius or not.&nbsp;
Shakspere, even the actor, was, perhaps, a man of genius, and
possessed this power of rapid acquisition and vivid retention of
all manner of experience and information.&nbsp; To what I suppose
to have been his opportunities in London, I shall return.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, let the doubter take up any popular English books of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s day: he will find them replete with much
knowledge wholly new to him&mdash;which he will also find in
Shakespeare.</p>
<p>A good example is this: Judge Webb proclaimed that in points
of scientific lore (the lore of that age) Shakespeare and Bacon
were much on a level.&nbsp; Professor Tyrrell, in a newspaper,
said that the facts staggered him, as a
&ldquo;Stratfordian.&rdquo;&nbsp; A friend told me that he too
was equally moved.&nbsp; I replied that these pseudoscientific
&ldquo;facts&rdquo; had long been commonplaces.&nbsp; Pliny was a
rich source of them.&nbsp; Professor Dowden took the matter up,
with full knowledge, <a name="citation93a"></a><a
href="#footnote93a" class="citation">[93a]</a> and reconverted
Mr. Tyrrell, who wrote: &ldquo;I am not versed in the literature
of the Shakespearian era, and I assumed that the Baconians who
put forward the parallelisms had satisfied themselves that the
coincidences were peculiar to the writings of the philosopher and
the poet.&nbsp; Professor Dowden has proved that this is not
so.&rdquo; <a name="citation93b"></a><a href="#footnote93b"
class="citation">[93b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>Were I
to enter seriously on this point of genius, I should begin by
requesting my adversaries to read Mr. F. W. H. Myers&rsquo;s
papers on &ldquo;The Mechanism of Genius&rdquo; (in his <i>Human
Personality</i>), and to consider the humble problem of
&ldquo;Calculating Boys,&rdquo; which is touched on also by
Cardinal Newman.&nbsp; How do they, at the age of innocence,
arrive at their amazing results?&nbsp; How did the child Pascal,
ignorant of Euclid, work out the Euclidean propositions of
&ldquo;bars and rounds,&rdquo; as he called lines and
circles?&nbsp; Science has no solution!</p>
<p>Transport the problem into the region of poetry and knowledge
of human nature, take Will in place of Pascal and Gauss, and (in
manners and matter of war) Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc;&mdash;and science,
I fancy, is much to seek for a reply.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood considers, among others, the case of Robert
Burns.&nbsp; The parallel is very interesting, and does not, I
think, turn so much to Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s advantage as he
supposes.&nbsp; The genius of Burns, of course, is far indeed
below the level of that of the author of the Shakespearean
plays.&nbsp; But that author and Burns have this in common with
each other (and obviously with Homer), that their work arises
from a basis of older materials, already manipulated by earlier
artists.&nbsp; Burns almost always has a key-note already
touched, as confessedly in the poems of his predecessor,
Fergusson; of Hamilton of Gilbertfield; in songs, popular or
artistic, and so forth.&nbsp; <a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>He &ldquo;alchemised&rdquo; his
materials, as Mr. Greenwood says of his author of the plays;
turned dross into gold, brick into marble.&nbsp; Notoriously much
Shakespearean work is of the same nature.</p>
<p>The education of Burns he owed to his peasant father, to his
parish school (in many such schools he might have acquired Latin
and Greek; in fact he did not), to a tutor who read with him some
English and French; and he knew a modernised version of Blind
Harry&rsquo;s <i>Wallace</i>; Locke&rsquo;s <i>Essay</i>; <i>The
Spectator</i>, novels of the day, and vernacular Scots poets of
his century, with a world of old Scots songs.&nbsp; These things,
and such as these, were Burns&rsquo;s given literary
materials.&nbsp; He used them in the only way open to him, in
poems written for a rural audience, and published for an
Edinburgh public.&nbsp; No classical, no theatrical materials
were given; or, if he read the old drama, he could not, in his
rural conditions, and in a Scotland where the theatre was in a
very small way, venture on producing plays, for which there was
no demand, while he had no knowledge of the Stage.&nbsp; Burns
found and filled the only channels open to him, in a printed
book, and in music books for which he transmuted old songs.</p>
<p>The bookish materials offered to Will, in London, were crammed
with reminiscences from the classics, were mainly romantic and
theatrical; and, from his profession of actor, by far the best
channel open to him was the theatre.&nbsp; Badly as it paid the
outside author, there was nothing <a name="page96"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 96</span>that paid better.&nbsp; <i>Venus and
Adonis</i> brought &ldquo;more praise than pudding,&rdquo; if one
may venture a guess.&nbsp; With the freedom of the theatre Will
could soar to all heights and plumb all depths.&nbsp; No such
opportunity had Burns, even if he could have used it, and, owing
to a variety of causes, his spirit soon ceased to soar high or
wing wide.</p>
<p>I take Shakespeare, in London at least, to have read the
current Elizabethan light literature&mdash;<i>Euphues</i>,
Lyly&rsquo;s Court comedies, novels full of the classics and of
social life; Spenser, Sidney&mdash;his <i>Defence of Poesy</i>,
and <i>Arcadia</i> (1590)&mdash;with scores of tales translated
from the Italian, French, and Spanish, all full of foreign
society, and discourses of knights and ladies.&nbsp; He saw the
plays of the day, perhaps as one of &ldquo;the
groundlings.&rdquo;&nbsp; He often beheld Society, from without,
when acting before the Queen and at great houses.&nbsp; He had
thus, if I am right, sufficient examples of style and manner, and
knowledge of how the great were supposed (in books) to comport
and conduct themselves.&nbsp; The books were cheap, and could be
borrowed, and turned over at the booksellers&rsquo; stalls. <a
name="citation96a"></a><a href="#footnote96a"
class="citation">[96a]</a>&nbsp; The Elizabethan style was
omnipresent.&nbsp; Suppose that Shakespeare was a clever man, a
lover of reading, a rapid reader with an excellent memory, easily
influenced, like Burns, by what he read, and I really think that
my conjectures are not too audacious.&nbsp; Not only &ldquo;the
man in <a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>the
street,&rdquo; but &ldquo;the reading public&rdquo; (so loved by
Coleridge), have not the beginning of a guess as to the way in
which a quick man reads.&nbsp; Watch them poring for hours over a
newspaper!&nbsp; Let me quote what Sir Walter Raleigh says: <a
name="citation97a"></a><a href="#footnote97a"
class="citation">[97a]</a> &ldquo;Shakespeare was one of those
swift and masterly readers who know what they want of a book;
they scorn nothing that is dressed in print, but turn over the
pages with a quick discernment of all that brings them new
information, or jumps with their thought, or tickles their
fancy.&nbsp; Such a reader will have done with a volume in a few
minutes, yet what he has taken from it he keeps for years.&nbsp;
He is a live man; and is sometimes judged by slower wits to be a
learned man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am taking Shakespeare to have been a reader of this kind, as
was Dr. Johnson, as are not a few men who have no pretensions to
genius.&nbsp; The accomplishment is only a marvel to&mdash;well,
I need not be particular about the kind of person to whom it is a
marvel!</p>
<p>Here, in fairness, the reader should be asked to consider an
eloquent passage of comparison between the knowledge of Burns and
of Will, quoted by Mr. Greenwood <a name="citation97b"></a><a
href="#footnote97b" class="citation">[97b]</a> from Mr. Morgan.
<a name="citation97c"></a><a href="#footnote97c"
class="citation">[97c]</a></p>
<p>Genius, says Mr. Morgan, &ldquo;did not guide Burns&rsquo;s
untaught pen to write of Troy or Egypt, of Athens and
Cyprus.&rdquo;&nbsp; No! that was not <a name="page98"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 98</span>Burns&rsquo;s lay; nor would he have
found a public had he emulated the contemporary St. Andrews
professor, Mr. Wilkie, who wrote <i>The Epigoniad</i>, and sang
of Cadmeian Thebes, to the delight of David Hume, his
friend.&nbsp; The public of 1780&ndash;90 did not want new epics
of heroic Greece from Mossgiel; nor was the literature accessible
to Burns full of the medi&aelig;val legends of Troy and
Athens.&nbsp; But the popular literature accessible to Will was
full of the <i>medi&aelig;val</i> legends of Thebes, Troy, and
Athens; and of these, <i>not</i> of Homer, Will made his
market.&nbsp; Egypt he knew only in the new English version of
Plutarch&rsquo;s <i>Lives</i>; of Homer, he (or the author of
<i>Troilus and Cressida</i>) used only Iliad VII., in
Chapman&rsquo;s new translation (1598).&nbsp; For the rest he had
Lydgate (perhaps), and, certainly, Caxton&rsquo;s <i>Destruction
of Troy</i>, still reprinted as a <i>popular</i> book as late as
1713.&nbsp; Will did not, as Mr. Morgan says, &ldquo;reproduce
the very counterfeit civilisations and manners of nations born
and buried and passed into history a thousand years before he had
been begotten. . . &rdquo;&nbsp; He bestowed the manners of
medi&aelig;val chivalrous romance on his Trojans and
Greeks.&nbsp; He accommodated prehistoric Athens with a
Duke.&nbsp; He gave Scotland cannon three hundred years too
early; and made Cleopatra play at billiards.&nbsp; Look at his
notion of &ldquo;the very manners&rdquo; of early post-Roman
Britain in <i>Cymbeline</i> and <i>King Lear</i>!&nbsp;
Concerning &ldquo;the anomalous status of a King of Scotland
under one of <a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>its primitive Kings&rdquo; the author of <i>Macbeth</i>
knew no more than what he read in Holinshed; of the actual truth
concerning Duncan (that old prince was, in fact, a young man
slain in a blacksmith&rsquo;s bothy), and of the whole affair,
the author knew nothing but a tissue of sophisticated
legends.&nbsp; The author of the plays had no knowledge (as Mr.
Morgan inexplicably declares that he had) of &ldquo;matters of
curious and occult research for antiquaries or dilettanti to dig
out of old romances or treaties or statutes rather than for
historians to treat of or schools to teach!&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Mon Dieu</i>! do historians <i>not</i> treat of
&ldquo;matters of curious research&rdquo; and of statutes and of
treaties?&nbsp; As for &ldquo;old romances,&rdquo; they were
current and popular.&nbsp; The &ldquo;occult&rdquo; sources of
<i>King Lear</i> are a popular tale attached to legendary
&ldquo;history&rdquo; and a story in Sidney&rsquo;s
<i>Arcadia</i>.&nbsp; Will, whom Mr. Morgan describes as &ldquo;a
letterless peasant lad,&rdquo; or the Author, whoever he was, is
not &ldquo;invested with all the love&rdquo; (<i>sic</i>,
<i>v.1.</i> &ldquo;lore&rdquo;), &ldquo;which the ages behind him
had shut up in clasped books and buried and forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our friend&rsquo;s style has flowery components,&rdquo;
Mr. Greenwood adds to this deliciously eloquent passage from his
American author, &ldquo;and yet Shakespeare who did all
this,&rdquo; <i>et c&aelig;tera</i>.&nbsp; But Shakespeare did
<i>not</i> do &ldquo;all this&rdquo;!&nbsp; We know the sources
of the plays well enough: novels in one of which
&ldquo;Delphos&rdquo; is the insular seat of an oracle of Apollo;
Holinshed, with his contaminated <a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>legends; North&rsquo;s
<i>Plutarch</i>, done out of the French; older plays, and the
rest of it.&nbsp; Shakespeare does not go to Tighernach and the
<i>Hennskringla</i> for Macbeth; or for Hamlet to the saga which
is the source of Saxo; or for his English chronicle-plays to the
State Papers.&nbsp; Shakespeare did not, like William of
Deloraine, dig up &ldquo;clasped books, buried and
forgotten.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is no original research; the author
uses the romances, novels, ballads, and popular books of
uncritical history which were current in his day.&nbsp; Mr.
Greenwood knows that; Mr. Morgan, perhaps, knew it, but forgot
what he knew; hurried away by the Muse of Eloquence.&nbsp; And
the common Baconian may believe Mr. Morgan.</p>
<p>But Mr. Greenwood asks &ldquo;what was the poetic
output?&rdquo; in Burns&rsquo;s case. <a
name="citation100a"></a><a href="#footnote100a"
class="citation">[100a]</a>&nbsp; It was what we know, and
<i>that</i> was what suited his age and his circumstances.&nbsp;
It was lyric, idyll, song, and satire; it was not drama, for to
the Stage he had no access, he who passed but one winter in
Edinburgh, where the theatre was not the centre of
literature.</p>
<p>Shakespeare came, with genius and with such materials as I
have suggested, to an entirely different market, the Elizabethan
theatre.&nbsp; I have tried to show how easily his mind might be
steeped in the all-pervading classicism and foreign romance of
the period, with the wide, sketchy, general information, the
commonly known fragments <a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>from the great banquet of the
classics,&mdash;with such history, wholly uncritical, as
Holinshed and Stow, and other such English chroniclers, could
copiously provide; with the courtly manners mirrored in scores of
romances and Court plays; and in the current popular <i>Morte
d&rsquo;Arthur</i> and <i>Destruction of Troy</i>.</p>
<p>I can agree with Mr. Greenwood, when he says that
&ldquo;Genius is a potentiality, and whether it will ever become
an actuality, and what it will produce, depends upon the moral
qualities with which it is associated, and the opportunities that
are open to it&mdash;in a word, on the circumstances of its
environment.&rdquo; <a name="citation101a"></a><a
href="#footnote101a" class="citation">[101a]</a></p>
<p>Of course by &ldquo;moral qualities,&rdquo; a character
without spot or stain is not intended: we may take that for
granted.&nbsp; Otherwise, I agree; and think that Shakespeare of
Stratford had genius, and that what it produced was in accordance
with the opportunities open to it, and with &ldquo;the
circumstances of its environment.&rdquo;&nbsp; Without the
&ldquo;environment,&rdquo; no Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc,&mdash;without
the environment, no Shakespeare.</p>
<p>To come to his own, Shakespeare needed the environment of
&ldquo;the light people,&rdquo; the crowd of wits living from
hand to mouth by literature, like Greene and Nash; and he needed
that pell-mell of the productions of their pens: the novels, the
poems, the pamphlets, and, above all, the plays, and the wine,
the wild talk, the wit, the <a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>travellers&rsquo; tales, the
seamen&rsquo;s company, the vision of the Court, the gallants,
the beauties; and he needed the People, of whom he does not speak
in the terms of such a philanthropist as Bacon professedly
was.&nbsp; Not as an aristocrat, a courtier, but as a simple
literary man, William does not like, though he thoroughly
understands, the mob.&nbsp; Like Alceste (in <i>Le
Misanthrope</i> of Poquelin), he might say,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>L&rsquo;Ami du genre humain n&rsquo;est
point du tout mon fait</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In London, not in Stratford, he could and did find his
mob.&nbsp; This reminds one to ask, how did the Court-haunting,
or the study-haunting, or law-court, and chamber of criminal
examination-rooms haunting Bacon make acquaintance with Mrs.
Quickly, and Doll Tearsheet, and drawers, and carters, and
Bardolph, and Pistol, and copper captains, and all
Shakespeare&rsquo;s crowd of people hanging loose on the
town?</p>
<p>It is much easier to discover how Shakespeare found the tone
and manners of courtly society (which, by the way, are purely
poetic and conventional), than to find out where Bacon got his
immense knowledge of what is called &ldquo;low life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you reply, as regards Bacon, &ldquo;his genius divined the
Costards and Audreys, the Doll Tearsheets and tapsters, and
drawers, and Bardolphs, and carters, from a hint or two, a
glance,&rdquo; I answer that Will had much better sources for
<i>them</i> in his own experience of life, and had conventional
<a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>poetic
sources for his courtiers&mdash;of whom, in the quick, he saw
quite as much as Moli&egrave;re did of his <i>Marquis</i>.</p>
<p>But one Baconian has found out a more excellent way of
accounting for Bacon&rsquo;s pictures of rude rustic life, and he
is backed by Lord Penzance, that aged Judge.&nbsp; The way is
short.&nbsp; These pictures of rural life and character were
interpolated into the plays of Bacon by his collaborator, William
Shakspere, actor, &ldquo;who prepared the plays for the
stage.&rdquo;&nbsp; This brilliant suggestion is borrowed from
Mr. Appleton Morgan. <a name="citation103a"></a><a
href="#footnote103a" class="citation">[103a]</a></p>
<p>Thus have these two Baconians perceived that it <i>is</i>
difficult to see how Bacon obtained his knowledge of certain
worlds and aspects of character which he could scarcely draw
&ldquo;from the life.&rdquo;&nbsp; I am willing to ascribe
miracles to the genius of Bacon; but the Baconians cited give the
honour to the actor, &ldquo;who prepared the plays for the
stage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Take it as you please, my Baconian friends who do not believe
as I believe in &ldquo;Genius.&rdquo;&nbsp; Shakespeare and
Moli&egrave;re did not live in &ldquo;Society,&rdquo; though both
rubbed shoulders with it, or looked at it over the invisible
barrier between the actor and the great people in whose houses or
palaces he takes the part of Entertainer.&nbsp; The rest they
divined, by genius.</p>
<p>Bacon did not, perhaps, study the society of <a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>carters,
drawers, Mrs. Quickly, and Doll Tearsheet; of copper captains and
their boys; not at Court, not in the study, did he meet
them.&nbsp; How then did he create his multitude of very
low-lived persons?&nbsp; Rustics and rural constables he
<i>may</i> have lovingly studied at Gorhambury, but for his
collection of other very loose fish Bacon must have kept queer
company.&nbsp; So you have to admit
&ldquo;Genius,&rdquo;&mdash;the miracle of &ldquo;Genius&rdquo;
in your Bacon,&mdash;to an even greater extent than I need it in
the case of my Will; or, like Lord Penzance, you may suggest that
Will collaborated with Bacon.</p>
<p>Try to imagine that Will was a born poet, like Burns, but with
a very different genius, education, and environment.&nbsp; Burns
could easily get at the Press, and be published: that was
impossible for Shakespeare at Stratford, if he had written any
lyrics.&nbsp; Suppose him to be a poet, an observer, a wit, a
humorist.&nbsp; Tradition at Stratford says something about the
humorist, and tradition, <i>in similar circumstances</i>, would
have remembered no more of Burns, after the lapse of seventy
years.</p>
<p>Imagine Will, then, to have the nature of a poet (that much I
am obliged to assume), and for nine or ten years, after leaving
school at thirteen, to hang about Stratford, observing nature and
man, flowers and foibles, with thoughts incommunicable to Sturley
and Quiney.&nbsp; Some sorts of park-palings, as he was married
at eighteen, he could not break so lightly as Burns
did,&mdash;some outlying <a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>deer he could not so readily shoot
at, perhaps, but I am not surprised if he assailed other deer,
and was in troubles many.&nbsp; Unlike Burns, he had a keen eye
for the main chance.&nbsp; Everything was going to ruin with his
father; school-mastering, if he tried it (I merely follow
tradition), was not satisfactory.&nbsp; His opinion of dominies,
if he wrote the plays, was identical with that frequently
expressed, in fiction and privately, by Sir Walter Scott.</p>
<p>Something must be done!&nbsp; Perhaps the straitest Baconian
will not deny that companies of players visited Stratford, or
even that he may have seen and talked with them, and been
attracted.&nbsp; He was a practical man, and he made for London,
and, by tradition, we first find him heading straight for the
theatre, holding horses at the door, and organising a small
brigade of boys as his deputies.&nbsp; According to Ben Jonson he
shone in conversation; he was good company, despite his rustic
accent, that terrible bar!&nbsp; The actors find that out; he is
admitted within the house as a &ldquo;servitor&rdquo;&mdash;a
call-boy, if you like; an apprentice, if you please.</p>
<p>By 1592, when Greene wrote his <i>Groatsworth</i>,
&ldquo;Shakescene&rdquo; thinks he can bombast out a blank verse
with the best; he is an actor, he is also an author, or a
furbisher of older plays, and, as a member of the company, is a
rival to be dreaded by Greene&rsquo;s three author friends:
whoever they were, they were professional University playwrights;
<a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>the
critics think that Marlowe, so near his death, was one of
them.</p>
<p>Will, supposing him to come upon the town in 1587, has now
had, say, five years of such opportunities as were open to a man
connected with the stage.&nbsp; Among these, in that age, we may,
perhaps, reckon a good deal of very mixed society&mdash;writing
men, bookish young blades, young blades who haunt the theatre,
and sit on the stage, as was the custom of the gallants.</p>
<p>What follows?&nbsp; Chaff follows, a kind of intimacy, a
supper, perhaps, after the play, if an actor seems to be good
company.&nbsp; This is quite natural; the most modish young
gallants are not so very dainty as to stand aloof from any
amusing company.&nbsp; They found it among prize-fighters, when
Byron was young, and extremely conscious of the fact that he was
a lord.&nbsp; Moreover there were no women on the stage to
distract the attention of the gallants.&nbsp; The players, says
Asinius Lupus, in Jonson&rsquo;s <i>Poetaster</i>, &ldquo;corrupt
young gentry very much, I know it.&rdquo;&nbsp; I take the
quotation from Mr. Greenwood. <a name="citation106a"></a><a
href="#footnote106a" class="citation">[106a]</a>&nbsp; They could
not corrupt the young gentry, if they were not pretty intimate
with them.&nbsp; From Ben&rsquo;s <i>Poetaster</i>, which
bristles with envy of the players, Mr. Greenwood also quotes a
railing address by a copper captain to Histrio, a poor actor,
&ldquo;There are some of you players honest, gentlemanlike
scoundrels, and suspected to ha&rsquo; some wit, as <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>well as
your poets, both at drinking and breaking of jests; <i>and are
companions for gallants</i>.&nbsp; A man may skelder ye, now and
then, of half a dozen shillings or so.&rdquo; <a
name="citation107a"></a><a href="#footnote107a"
class="citation">[107a]</a>&nbsp; We think of Nigel Olifaunt in
<i>The Fortunes of Nigel</i>; but better gallants might choose to
have some acquaintance with Shakespeare.</p>
<p>To suppose that young men of position would not form a
playhouse acquaintanceship with an amusing and interesting actor
seems to me to show misunderstanding of human nature.&nbsp; The
players were, when unprotected by men of rank,
&ldquo;vagabonds.&rdquo;&nbsp; The citizens of London, mainly
Puritans, hated them mortally, but the young gallants were not
Puritans.&nbsp; The Court patronised the actors who performed
Masques in palaces and great houses.&nbsp; The wealth and
splendid attire of the actors, their acquisition of land and of
coats of arms infuriated the sweated playwrights.&nbsp; Envy of
the actors appears in the Cambridge &ldquo;Parnassus&rdquo; plays
of <i>c.</i> 1600&ndash;2.&nbsp; In the mouth of Will Kempe, who
acted Dogberry in Shakespeare&rsquo;s company, and was in favour,
says Heywood, with Queen Elizabeth, the Cambridge authors put
this brag: &ldquo;For Londoners, who of more report than Dick
Burbage and Will Kempe?&nbsp; He is not counted a gentleman that
knows not Dick Burbage and Will Kempe.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is not my
opinion that Shakespeare was, as Ben Jonson came to be, as much
&ldquo;in Society&rdquo; as is possible for a mere literary
man.&nbsp; I do not, in fancy, see <a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>him wooing a Maid of Honour.&nbsp;
He was a man&rsquo;s man, a peer might be interested in him as
easily as in a jockey, a fencer, a tennis-player, a musician,
<i>que s&ccedil;ais-je</i>?&nbsp; Southampton, discovering his
qualities, may have been more interested, interested in a better
way.</p>
<p>In such circumstances which are certainly in accordance with
human nature, I suppose the actor to have been noticed by the
young, handsome, popular Earl of Southampton; who found him
interesting, and interested himself in the poet.&nbsp; There
followed the dedication to the Earl of <i>Venus and Adonis</i>; a
poem likely to please any young amorist (1693).</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood cries out at the audacity of a player dedicating
to an Earl, without even saying that he has asked leave to
dedicate.&nbsp; The mere fact that the dedication was accepted,
and followed by that of <i>Lucrece</i>, proves that the Earl did
not share the surprise of Mr. Greenwood.&nbsp; He, conceivably,
will argue that the Earl knew the real concealed author, and the
secret of the pseudonym.&nbsp; But of the hypothesis of such a
choice of a pseudonym, enough has been said.&nbsp; Whatever
happened, whatever the Earl knew, if it were discreditable to be
dedicated to by an actor, Southampton was discredited; for we are
to prove that all in the world of letters and theatre who have
left any notice of Shakespeare identified the actor with the
poet.</p>
<p>This appears to me to be the natural way of <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>looking at
the affair.&nbsp; But, says Mr. Greenwood, of this intimacy or
&ldquo;patronage&rdquo; of Southampton &ldquo;not a scrap of
evidence exists.&rdquo; <a name="citation109a"></a><a
href="#footnote109a" class="citation">[109a]</a>&nbsp; Where
would Mr. Greenwood expect to find a scrap of evidence?&nbsp; In
literary anecdote?&nbsp; Of contemporary literary anecdote about
Shakespeare, as about Beaumont, Dekker, Chapman, Heywood, and
Fletcher, there is none, or next to none.&nbsp; There is the
tradition that Southampton gave the poet &pound;1000 towards a
purchase to which he had a mind.&nbsp; (Rowe seems to have got
this from Davenant,&mdash;through Betterton.)&nbsp; In what
documents would the critic expect to find a scrap of
evidence?&nbsp; Perhaps in Southampton&rsquo;s book of his
expenditure, and that does not exist.&nbsp; It is in the accounts
of Prince Charlie that I find him, poor as he was, giving money
to Jean Jacques Rousseau.</p>
<p>As to the chances of an actor&rsquo;s knowing &ldquo;smart
people,&rdquo; Heywood, who knew all that world, tells us <a
name="citation109b"></a><a href="#footnote109b"
class="citation">[109b]</a> that &ldquo;Tarleton, in his time,
was gracious with the Queen, his sovereign,&rdquo; Queen
Elizabeth.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will Kempe was in the favour of his
sovereign.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>They</i> had advantages, they were not literary men, but
low comedians.&nbsp; I am not pretending that, though his</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;flights upon the banks of
Thames<br />
So did take Eliza and our James,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Will Shakspere &ldquo;was gracious with the Queen.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>We
may compare the dedication of the Folio of 1623; here two players
address the Earls of Pembroke and Montgomery.&nbsp; They have the
audacity to say nothing about having asked and received
permission to dedicate.&nbsp; They say that the Earls &ldquo;have
prosecuted both the plays and their authour living&rdquo; (while
in life) &ldquo;with much favour.&rdquo;&nbsp; They &ldquo;have
collected and published the works of &lsquo;the dead&rsquo; . . .
only to keep alive the memory of so worthy a Friend, and
Fellow&rdquo; (associate) &ldquo;as was our Shakespeare,
&lsquo;your servant Shakespeare.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing can possibly be more explicit, both as to the
actor&rsquo;s authorship of the plays, and as to the favour in
which the two Earls held him.&nbsp; Mr. Greenwood <a
name="citation110a"></a><a href="#footnote110a"
class="citation">[110a]</a> supposes that Jonson wrote the
Preface, which contains an allusion to a well-known ode of
Horace, and to a phrase of Pliny.&nbsp; Be that as it may, the
Preface signed by the two players speaks to Pembroke and
Montgomery.&nbsp; To <i>them</i> it cannot lie; <i>they</i> know
whether they patronised the actor or not; whether they believed,
or not, that the plays were their
&ldquo;servant&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp; How is Mr. Greenwood to
overcome this certain testimony of the Actors, to the identity of
their late &ldquo;Fellow&rdquo; the player, with the author; and
to the patronage which the Earls bestowed on him and his
compositions?&nbsp; Mr. Greenwood says nothing except that we may
reasonably suppose <a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>Ben to have written the dedication which the players
signed. <a name="citation111a"></a><a href="#footnote111a"
class="citation">[111a]</a></p>
<p>Whether or not the two Earls had a personal knowledge of
Shakespeare, the dedication does not say in so many words.&nbsp;
They had seen his plays and had &ldquo;favoured&rdquo; both him
and them, with so much favour, had &ldquo;used indulgence&rdquo;
to the author.&nbsp; That is not nearly explicit enough for the
precise Baconians.&nbsp; But the Earls knew whether what was said
were true or false.&nbsp; I am not sure whether the Baconians
regard them as having been duped as to the authorship, or as
fellow-conspirators with Ben in the great Baconian joke and
mystery&mdash;that &ldquo;William Shakespeare&rdquo; the author
is not the actor whose Stratford friend, Collyns, has his name
written in legal documents as &ldquo;William
Shakespeare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anyone, however, may prefer to believe that, while William
Shakspere was acting in a company (1592&ndash;3), Bacon, or who
you please, wrote <i>Venus and Adonis</i>, and, signing &ldquo;W.
Shakspeare,&rdquo; dedicated it to his young friend, the Earl,
promising to add &ldquo;some graver labour,&rdquo; a promise
fulfilled in <i>Lucrece</i>.&nbsp; In 1593, Bacon was chiefly
occupied, we shall see, with the affairs of a young and beautiful
Earl&mdash;the Earl of Essex, not of Southampton: to Essex he did
not dedicate his two poems (if <i>Venus</i> and <i>Lucrece</i>
were his).&nbsp; He &ldquo;did nothing but ruminate&rdquo; (he
tells the world) on Essex.&nbsp; How Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s
Unknown was <a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>occupied in 1593&ndash;4, of course we cannot possibly
be aware.</p>
<p>I have thus tried to show that Will Shakspere, if he had as
much schooling as I suggest; and if he had four or five years of
life in London, about the theatre, and, above all, had genius,
might, by 1592, be the rising player-author alluded to as
&ldquo;Shakescene.&rdquo;&nbsp; There remains a difficulty.&nbsp;
By 1592 Will had not time to be guilty of <i>thirteen</i> plays,
or even of six.&nbsp; But I have not credited him with the
authorship, between, say, 1587 and 1593, of eleven plays, namely,
<i>Hamlet</i>, <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, <i>Midsummer
Night&rsquo;s Dream</i>, <i>Titus Andronicus</i>, <i>Comedy of
Errors</i>, <i>Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost</i>, <i>King
John</i>, the three plays of <i>Henry VI</i>, and <i>The Taming
of the Shrew</i>.&nbsp; Mr. Greenwood <a
name="citation112a"></a><a href="#footnote112a"
class="citation">[112a]</a> cites Judge Webb for the fact that
between the end of 1587 and the end of 1592 &ldquo;some
half-dozen Shakespearean dramas had been written,&rdquo; and for
Dr. Furnivall&rsquo;s opinion that eleven had been composed.</p>
<p>If I believed that half a dozen, or eleven Shakespearean
plays, as we have them, had been written or composed, between
1587 and 1592, I should be obliged to say that, in my opinion,
they were not composed, in these five years, by Will.&nbsp; Mr.
Greenwood writes, &ldquo;Some of the dates are disputable&rdquo;;
and, for himself, would omit &ldquo;<i>Titus Andronicus</i>, the
three plays of <i>Henry VI</i>, and possibly also <i>The Taming
of the Shrew</i>, while <a name="page113"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 113</span>the reference to <i>Hamlet</i> also
is, as I have elsewhere shown, of very doubtful force.&rdquo; <a
name="citation113a"></a><a href="#footnote113a"
class="citation">[113a]</a>&nbsp; This leaves us with six of Dr.
Furnivall&rsquo;s list of earliest plays put out of action.&nbsp;
The miracle is decomposing, but plays numerous enough to stagger
my credulity remain.</p>
<p>I cannot believe that the author even of the five plays before
1592&ndash;3 was the ex-butcher&rsquo;s boy.&nbsp; Meanwhile
these five plays, written by somebody before 1593, meet the
reader on the threshold of Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s book <a
name="citation113b"></a><a href="#footnote113b"
class="citation">[113b]</a> with Dr. Furnivall&rsquo;s eleven;
and they fairly frighten him, if he be a
&ldquo;Stratfordian.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Will, even Will,&rdquo;
says the Stratfordian, &ldquo;could not have composed the five,
much less the eleven, much less Mr. Edwin Reed&rsquo;s thirteen
&lsquo;before 1592.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation113c"></a><a
href="#footnote113c" class="citation">[113c]</a>&nbsp; But, at
the close of his work <a name="citation113d"></a><a
href="#footnote113d" class="citation">[113d]</a> Mr. Greenwood
reviews and disbands that unlucky troop of thirteen Shakespearean
plays &ldquo;before 1592&rdquo; as mustered by Mr. Reed, a
Baconian of whom Mr. Collins wrote in terms worthy of <i>feu</i>
Mr. Bludyer of <i>The Tomahawk</i>.</p>
<p>From the five plays left to Shakespeare&rsquo;s account in p.
51, <i>King John</i> (as we know it) is now eliminated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I find it impossible to believe that the same man was the
author of the drama&rdquo; (<i>The Troublesome Reign of King
John</i>) &ldquo;published <a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>in 1591, and that which, so far as
we know, first saw the light in the Folio of 1623 . . .&nbsp;
Hardly a single line of the original version reappears in the
<i>King John</i> of Shakespeare.&rdquo; <a
name="citation114a"></a><a href="#footnote114a"
class="citation">[114a]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;I think it is a mistake
to endeavour to fortify the argument against him&rdquo; (my Will,
<i>toi que j&rsquo;aime</i>), &ldquo;by ascribing to Shakespeare
such old plays as the <i>King John</i> of 1591 or the primitive
<i>Hamlet</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation114b"></a><a
href="#footnote114b" class="citation">[114b]</a></p>
<p>I thought so too, when I read p. 51, and saw <i>King John</i>
apparently still &ldquo;coloured on the card&rdquo; among
&ldquo;Shakespeare&rsquo;s lot.&rdquo;&nbsp; We are now left with
<i>Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost</i>, <i>Midsummer
Night&rsquo;s Dream</i>, <i>Comedy of Errors</i>, and <i>Romeo
and Juliet</i>, out of Dr. Furnivall&rsquo;s list of plays up to
1593.&nbsp; The phantom force of miraculously early plays is
&ldquo;following darkness like a dream.&rdquo;&nbsp; We do not
know the date of <i>A Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</i>, we do
not know the date of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>.&nbsp; Mr. Gollancz
dates the former &ldquo;about 1592,&rdquo; and the latter
&ldquo;at 1591.&rdquo; <a name="citation114c"></a><a
href="#footnote114c" class="citation">[114c]</a>&nbsp; This is a
mere personal speculation.&nbsp; Of <i>Love&rsquo;s
Labour&rsquo;s Lost</i>, we only know that our version is one
&ldquo;corrected and augmented&rdquo; by William Shakespeare in
1598.&nbsp; I dare say it is as early as 1591&ndash;2, in its
older form.&nbsp; Of <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>, Mr. Collins
wrote, &ldquo;It is all but certain that it was written between
1589 and 1592, and it is quite certain that it was written before
the end of 1594.&rdquo; <a name="citation114d"></a><a
href="#footnote114d" class="citation">[114d]</a></p>
<p>The legion of Shakespearean plays of date <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>before 1593
has vanished.&nbsp; The miracle is very considerably
abated.&nbsp; In place of introducing the airy hosts of plays
before 1592, in p. 51, it would have been, perhaps, more
instructive to write that, as far as we can calculate,
Shakespeare&rsquo;s earliest trials of his pinions as a dramatist
may be placed about 1591&ndash;3.&nbsp; There would then have
been no specious appearance of miracles to be credited by
Stratfordians to Will.&nbsp; But even so, we have sufficient to
&ldquo;give us pause,&rdquo; says Mr. Greenwood, with
justice.&nbsp; It gives <i>me</i> &ldquo;pause,&rdquo; if I am to
believe that, between 1587 and 1592, Will wrote <i>Love&rsquo;s
Labour&rsquo;s Lost</i>, <i>The Comedy of Errors</i>, <i>A
Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream</i>, and <i>Romeo and
Juliet</i>.&nbsp; There is a limit even to my gullibility, and if
anyone wrote all these plays, as we now possess them, before
1593, I do not suppose that Will was the man.&nbsp; But the
dates, in fact, are unknown: the miracle is apocryphal.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE COURTLY PLAYS: &ldquo;LOVE&rsquo;S
LABOUR&rsquo;S LOST&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> now come to consider another
&ldquo;miracle&rdquo; discovered in the plays,&mdash;a miracle if
the actor be the author.&nbsp; The new portent is the courtliness
and refinement (too often, alas! the noblest ladies make the
coarsest jokes) and wit of the speeches of the noble gentlemen
and ladies in the plays.&nbsp; To be sure the refinement in the
jests is often conspicuously absent.&nbsp; How could the rude
actor learn his quips and pretty phrases, and farfetched
conceits?&nbsp; This question I have tried to answer
already,&mdash;the whole of these fashions abound in the
literature of the day.</p>
<p>Here let us get rid of the assumption that a poet could not
make the ladies and gentlemen of his plays converse as they do
converse, whether in quips and airs and graces, or in loftier
style, unless he himself frequented their society.&nbsp; Marlowe
did not frequent the best society; <i>he</i> was no courtier, but
there is the high courtly style in the speeches of the great and
noble in <i>Edward II</i>.&nbsp; Courtiers and kings never did
speak in this manner, any more than they spoke in blank
verse.&nbsp; The style is a poetical convention, while the quips
and conceits, the airs and graces, ran riot <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>through the
literature of the age of Lyly and his <i>Euphues</i> and his
comedies, the age of the <i>Arcadia</i>.</p>
<p>A cheap and probable source of Will&rsquo;s courtliness is to
be found in the courtly comedies of John Lyly, five of which were
separately printed between 1584 and 1592.&nbsp; Lyly&rsquo;s
&ldquo;real significance is that he was the first to bring
together on the English stage the elements of high comedy,
thereby preparing the way for Shakespeare&rsquo;s <i>Much Ado
about Nothing</i> and <i>As You Like It</i>&rdquo; (and
<i>Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost</i>, one may add).&nbsp;
&ldquo;Whoever knows his Shakespeare and his Lyly well can hardly
miss the many evidences that Shakespeare had read Lyly&rsquo;s
plays almost as closely as Lyly had read Pliny&rsquo;s <i>Natural
History</i>. . . .&nbsp; One could hardly imagine <i>Love&rsquo;s
Labour&rsquo;s Lost</i> as existent in the period from 1590 to
1600, had not Lyly&rsquo;s work just preceded it.&rdquo; <a
name="citation120a"></a><a href="#footnote120a"
class="citation">[120a]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;It is to Lyly&rsquo;s plays,&rdquo; writes Dr.
Landmann, &ldquo;that Shakespeare owes so much in the liveliness
of his dialogues, in smartness of expression, and especially in
that predilection for witticisms, quibbles, and playing upon
words which he shows in his comedies as well as in his
tragedies.&rdquo;&nbsp; There follows a dissertation on the
affected styles of Guevara and Gongora, of the
<i>Pl&eacute;iade</i> in France, and generally of the artificial
manner in Europe, till in England we reach Lyly, &ldquo;in whose
comedies,&rdquo; <a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>says Dr. Furness, &ldquo;I think we should look for
motives which appeared later in Shakespeare.&rdquo; <a
name="citation121a"></a><a href="#footnote121a"
class="citation">[121a]</a></p>
<p>The Baconians who think that a poet could not derive from
books and court plays his knowledge of fashions far more
prevalent in literature than at Court, decide that the poet of
<i>Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost</i> was not Will, but the
courtly &ldquo;concealed poet.&rdquo;&nbsp; No doubt Baconians
may argue with Mr. R. M. Theobald <a name="citation121b"></a><a
href="#footnote121b" class="citation">[121b]</a> that
&ldquo;Bacon wrote Marlowe,&rdquo; and, by parity of reasoning
many urge, though Mr. Theobald does not, that Bacon wrote Lyly,
pouring into Lyly&rsquo;s comedies the grace and wit, the quips
and conceits of his own courtly youth.&nbsp; &ldquo;What for
no?&rdquo;&nbsp; The hypothesis is as good as the other
hypotheses, &ldquo;Bacon wrote Marlowe,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bacon wrote
Shakespeare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The less impulsive Baconians and the Anti-Willians appear to
ignore the well-known affected novels which were open to all the
world, and are noted even in short educational histories of
English literature.&nbsp; Shakespeare, in London, had only to
look at the books on the stalls, to read or, if he had the
chance, to see Lyly&rsquo;s plays, and read the poems of the
time.&nbsp; I am taking him not to be a dullard but a poet.&nbsp;
It was not hard for him, if he were a poet of genius, not only to
catch the manner of Lyly&rsquo;s Court comedies, and
&ldquo;Marlowe&rsquo;s mighty line&rdquo; (Marlowe was not <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>&ldquo;brought up on the knees of
Marchionesses&rdquo;!), but to improve on them.&nbsp; People did
not commonly talk in the poetical way, heaven knows; people did
not write in the poetic convention.&nbsp; Certainly Queen Mary
and Queen Elizabeth talked and wrote, as a rule (we have
abundance of their letters), like women of this world.&nbsp;
There is a curious exception in Letter VIII of the Casket Letters
from Mary to Bothwell.&nbsp; In this (we have a copy of the
original French), Mary plunges into the affected and figured
style already practised by <i>Les Pr&eacute;cieuses</i> of her
day; and expands into symbolisms in a fantastic jargon.&nbsp; If
courtiers of both sexes conversed in the style of <i>Euphues</i>
(which is improbable), they learned the trick of it from
<i>Euphues</i>; not the author of <i>Euphues</i> from them.&nbsp;
Lyly&rsquo;s most popular prose was accessible to
Shakespeare.&nbsp; The whole convention as to how the great
should speak and bear themselves was accessible in poetry and the
drama.&nbsp; A man of genius naturally made his ladies and
courtiers more witty, more &ldquo;conceited,&rdquo; more
eloquent, more gracious than any human beings ever were anywhere,
in daily life.</p>
<p>It seems scarcely credible that one should be obliged to urge
facts so obvious against the Baconian argument that only a Bacon,
intimately familiar with the society of the great, could make the
great speak as, in the plays, they do&mdash;and as in real life
they probably did <i>not</i>!</p>
<p>We now look at <i>Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost</i>,
published <a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>in quarto, in 1598, as &ldquo;corrected and augmented
by W. Shakespere.&rdquo;&nbsp; The date of composition is
unknown, but the many varieties of versification, with some
allusions, mark it as among the earliest of the dramas.&nbsp;
Supposing that Shakespeare obtained his knowledge of fine manners
and speech, and of the tedious quips and conceits which he
satirises, from the contemporary poems, plays, and novels which
abounded in them, and from <i>pr&eacute;cieux</i> and
<i>pr&eacute;cieuses</i> who imitated them, as I suggest, even
then <i>Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost</i> is an extremely
eccentric piece.&nbsp; I cannot imagine how a man who knew the
foreign politics of his age as Bacon did, could have dreamed of
writing anything so eccentric, that is, if it has any connection
with foreign politics of the time.</p>
<p>The scene is the Court of <i>Ferdinand</i>, King of
Navarre.&nbsp; In 1589&ndash;93, the eyes of England were fixed
on the Court of her ally, <i>Henri</i> of Navarre, in his
struggle with the League and the Guises; the War of
Religion.&nbsp; But the poet calls the King
&ldquo;Ferdinand,&rdquo; taking perhaps from some story this
non-existent son of Charles III of Navarre (died 1425): to whom,
according to Monstrelet, the Burgundian chronicler of that time,
the French king owed 200,000 ducats of gold.&nbsp; This is a
transaction of the early fifteenth century, and leads to the
presence of the princess of France as an envoy at the Court of
Navarre in the play; the whole thing is quite unhistorical, and
has <a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>the
air of being borrowed from some lost story or brief novel.&nbsp;
Bacon&rsquo;s brother, Anthony, was English minister at the Court
of Navarre.&nbsp; What could tempt Bacon to pick out a
non-historical King Ferdinand of Navarre, plant him in the
distant days of Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc, and make him, at that period,
found an Academe for three years of austere study and absence of
women?&nbsp; But, if Bacon did this, what could induce him to
give to the non-existent Ferdinand, as companions, the
Mar&eacute;chal de Biron with de Longueville (both of them, in
1589&ndash;93, the chief adherents of Henri of Navarre), and add
to them &ldquo;Dumain,&rdquo; that is, the Duc de Mayenne, one of
the Guises, the deadly foes of Henri and of the Huguenots?&nbsp;
Even in the unhistorically minded Shakespeare, the freak is of
the most eccentric,&mdash;but in Bacon this friskiness is indeed
strange.&nbsp; I cannot, like Mr. Greenwood, <a
name="citation124a"></a><a href="#footnote124a"
class="citation">[124a]</a> find any &ldquo;allusions to the
Civil War of France.&rdquo;&nbsp; France and Navarre, in the
play, are in full peace.</p>
<p>The actual date of the fabulous King Ferdinand would have been
about 1430.&nbsp; By introducing Biron, Longueville, and the Duc
de Mayenne, and Bankes&rsquo;s celebrated educated horse, the
author shifts the date to 1591.&nbsp; But the Navarre of the play
is a region &ldquo;out of space, out of time,&rdquo; a fairy
world of projected Academes (like that of the four young men in
de la Primaudaye&rsquo;s <i>L&rsquo;Acad&eacute;mie
Fran&ccedil;aise</i>, Englished in 1586) and of <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>peace,
while the actual King of Navarre of 1591 was engaged in a
struggle for life and faith; and in his ceaseless amours.</p>
<p>Many of Shakespeare&rsquo;s anachronisms are easily
intelligible.&nbsp; He takes a novel or story about any remote
period, or he chooses, as for the <i>Midsummer Night&rsquo;s
Dream</i>, a period earlier than that of the Trojan war.&nbsp; He
gives to the Athens contemporary with the &ldquo;Late Minoan
III&rdquo; period (1600 <span class="GutSmall">B.C.</span>?) a
Duke, and his personages live like English nobles and rustics of
his own day, among the fairies of English folk-lore.&nbsp; It is
the manner of Chaucer and of the poets and painters of any age
before the end of the eighteenth century.&nbsp; The resulting
anachronisms are natural and intelligible.&nbsp; We do not expect
war-chariots in <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>; it is when the
author makes the bronze-clad Ach&aelig;ans familiar with Plato
and Aristotle that we are surprised.&nbsp; In <i>Love&rsquo;s
Labour&rsquo;s Lost</i> we do not expect the author to introduce
the manners of the early fifteenth century, the date of the
affair of the 200,000 ducats.&nbsp; Let the play reflect the men
and manners of 1589&ndash;93,&mdash;but why place Mayenne, a
fanatical Catholic foe of Navarre, among the courtiers of the
Huguenot King of Navarre?</p>
<p>As for de Mayenne (under the English spelling of the day
Dumain) appearing as a courtier of his hated adversary Henri,
Bacon, of all men, could not have made that absurd error.&nbsp;
It was Shakespeare who took but an absent-minded <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>interest in
foreign politics.&nbsp; If Bacon is building his play on an
affair, the ducats, of 1425&ndash;35 (roughly speaking), he
should not bring in a performing horse, trained by Bankes, a
Staffordshire man, which was performing its tricks at
Shrewsbury&mdash;in 1591. <a name="citation126a"></a><a
href="#footnote126a" class="citation">[126a]</a>&nbsp; Thus early
we find that great scholar mixing up chronology in a way which,
in Shakespeare even, surprises; but, in Bacon, seems quite out of
keeping.</p>
<p>Shakespeare, as Sir Sidney Lee says, gives Mayenne as
&ldquo;Dumain,&rdquo;&mdash;Mayenne, &ldquo;whose name was so
frequently mentioned in popular accounts of French affairs in
connection with Navarre&rsquo;s movements that Shakespeare was
led to number him also among his supporters.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bacon
would not have been so led!&nbsp; As Mayenne and Henri fought
against each other at Ivry, in 1590, this was carrying nonsense
far, even for Will, but for the earnestly instructive Bacon!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The habits of the author could not have been more
scholastic,&rdquo; so Judge Webb is quoted, &ldquo;if he had,
like Bacon, spent three years in the University of Cambridge . .
. &rdquo;&nbsp; Bacon, or whoever corrected the play in 1598,
might have corrected &ldquo;primater&rdquo; into &ldquo;pia
mater,&rdquo; unless Bacon intended the blunder for a malapropism
of &ldquo;Nathaniel, a Curate.&rdquo;&nbsp; Either Will or Bacon,
either in fun or ignorance, makes Nathaniel turn a common Italian
proverb on Venice into gibberish.&nbsp; It was familiar in
Florio&rsquo;s <i>Second </i><a name="page127"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 127</span><i>Frutes</i> (1591), and <i>First
Frutes</i> (1578), with the English translation.&nbsp; The books
were as accessible to Shakspere as to Bacon.&nbsp; Either author
might also draw from James Sandford&rsquo;s <i>Garden of
Pleasure</i>, done out of the Italian in 1573&ndash;6.</p>
<p>Where the scholastic habits of Bacon at Cambridge are to be
discovered in this play, I know not, unless it be in
Biron&rsquo;s witty speech against study.&nbsp; If the wit
implies in the author a Cambridge education, Costard and Dull and
Holofernes imply familiarity with rustics and country
schoolmasters.&nbsp; Where the author proves that he &ldquo;could
not have been more familiar with French politics if, like Bacon,
he had spent three years in the train of an Ambassador to
France,&rdquo; I cannot conjecture.&nbsp; <i>There are no French
politics in the piece</i>, any more than there are
&ldquo;mysteries of fashionable life,&rdquo; such as Bacon might
have heard of from Essex and Southampton.&nbsp; There is no
&ldquo;familiarity with all the gossip of the Court&rdquo;; there
is no greater knowledge of foreign proverbs than could be got
from common English books.&nbsp; There is abundance, indeed
overabundance of ridicule of affected styles, and quips, with
which the literature of the day was crammed: call it Gongorism,
Euphuism, or what you please.&nbsp; One does not understand how
or where Judge Webb (in extreme old age) made all these
discoveries, sympathetically quoted by Mr. Greenwood. <a
name="citation127a"></a><a href="#footnote127a"
class="citation">[127a]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Like Bacon, the author
of the play must have had a large <a name="page128"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 128</span>command of books; he must have had
his &ldquo;Horace,&rdquo; his &ldquo;Ovidius Naso,&rdquo; and his
&ldquo;good old &lsquo;Mantuan.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; What a
prodigious &ldquo;command of books&rdquo;!&nbsp; Country
schoolmasters confessedly had these books on the school
desks.&nbsp; It was not even necessary for the author to
&ldquo;have access to the <i>Chronicles</i> of
Monstrelet.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is not known, we have said, whether
or not such plot as the play possesses, with King Ferdinand and
the 100,000 ducats, or 200,000 ducats (needed to bring the
Princess and the mythical King Ferdinand of Navarre together),
were not adapted by the poet from an undiscovered <i>conte</i>,
partly based on a passage in Monstrelet.</p>
<p>Perhaps it will be conceded that <i>Love&rsquo;s
Labour&rsquo;s Lost</i> is not a play which can easily be
attributed to Bacon.&nbsp; We do not know how much of the play
existed before Shakespeare &ldquo;augmented&rdquo; it in
1598.&nbsp; We do not know whether what he then corrected and
augmented was an early work of his own or from another hand,
though probably it was his own.&nbsp; Moli&egrave;re certainly
corrected and augmented and transfigured, in his illustrious
career in Paris, several of the brief early sketches which he had
written when he was the chief of a strolling <i>troupe</i> in
Southern France.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood does not attribute the wit (such as it is), the
quips, the conceits, the affectations satirised in
<i>Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost</i>, to Will&rsquo;s
knowledge of the artificial style then prevalent in all the
literatures of Western Europe, and in <a name="page129"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 129</span>England most pleasingly used in
Lyly&rsquo;s comedies.&nbsp; No, &ldquo;the author must have been
not only a man of high intellectual culture, but one who was
intimately acquainted with the ways of the Court, and the
fashionable society of his time, as also with contemporary
foreign politics.&rdquo; <a name="citation129a"></a><a
href="#footnote129a" class="citation">[129a]</a></p>
<p>I search the play once more for the faintest hint of knowledge
of foreign politics.&nbsp; The embassy of the daughter of the
King of France (who, by the date of the affair of the ducats,
should be Charles VII) has been compared to a diplomatic sally of
the mother of the childless actual King of France (Henri III), in
1586, when Catherine de Medici was no chicken.&nbsp; I do not see
in the embassy of the Princess of the story any &ldquo;intimate
acquaintance with contemporary foreign politics&rdquo; about
1591&ndash;3.&nbsp; The introduction of Mayenne as an adherent of
the King of Navarre, shows either a most confused ignorance of
foreign politics on the part of the author, or a freakish
contempt for his public.&nbsp; I am not aware that the author
shows any &ldquo;intimate acquaintance with the ways&rdquo; of
Elizabeth&rsquo;s Court, or of any other fashionable society,
except the Courts which Fancy held in plays.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood <a name="citation129b"></a><a
href="#footnote129b" class="citation">[129b]</a> appears to be
repeating &ldquo;the case as to this very remarkable play&rdquo;
as &ldquo;well summed up by the late Judge Webb in his <i>Mystery
of William Shakespeare</i>&rdquo; (p. 44).&nbsp; In that <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>paralysing
judicial summary, as we have seen, &ldquo;the author could not
have been more familiar with French politics if, like Bacon, he
had spent three years in the train of an Ambassador to
France.&rdquo;&nbsp; The French politics, in the play, are to
send the daughter of a King of France (the contemporary King
Henri III was childless) to conduct a negotiation about 200,000
ducats, at the Court, steeped in peace, of a King of Navarre, a
scholar who would fain be a recluse from women, in an Academe of
his own device.&nbsp; Such was not the Navarre of Henri in his
war with the Guises, and Henri did not shun the sex!</p>
<p>Such are the &ldquo;contemporary foreign politics,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;French politics&rdquo; which the author knows&mdash;as
intimately as Bacon might have known them.&nbsp; They are not
foreign politics, they are not French politics, they are politics
of fairy-land: with which Will was at least as familiar as
Bacon.</p>
<p>These, then, are the arguments in favour of Bacon, or the
Great Unknown, which are offered with perfect solemnity of
assurance: and the Baconians repeat them in their little books of
popularisation and propaganda.&nbsp; <i>Quantula
sapientia</i>!</p>
<h2><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>VII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">CONTEMPORARY RECOGNITION OF WILL AS
AUTHOR</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is absolutely impossible to
prove that Will, or Bacon, or the Man in the Moon, was the author
of the Shakespearean plays and poems.&nbsp; But it is easy to
prove that Will was recognised as the author, by Ben Jonson,
Heywood, and Heminge and Condell the actors, to take the best
witnesses.&nbsp; Meanwhile we have received no hint that any man
except Will was ever suspected of being the author till 1856,
when the twin stars of Miss Delia Bacon and Mr. Smith
arose.&nbsp; The evidence of Ben Jonson and the rest can only
prove that professed playwrights and actors, who knew Will both
on and off the stage, saw nothing in him not compatible with his
work.&nbsp; Had he been the kind of letterless country fellow, or
bookless fellow whom the Baconians and Mr. Greenwood describe,
the contemporary witnesses cited must have detected Will in a
day; and the story of the &ldquo;Concealed Poet&rdquo; who
really, at first, did the additions and changes in the
Company&rsquo;s older manuscript plays, and of the inconceivably
impudent pretences of Will of Stratford, would have kept the town
merry for a month.&nbsp; Five or six <a name="page134"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 134</span>threadbare scholars would have sat
down at a long table in a tavern room, and, after their manner,
dashed off a Comedy of Errors on the real and the false
playwright.</p>
<p>Baconians never seem to think of the mechanical difficulties
in their assumed literary hoax.&nbsp; If Will, like the old
Hermit of Prague who never saw pen and ink, could not even write,
the hoax was a physical impossibility.&nbsp; If he could write,
but was a rough bookless man, his condition would be scarcely the
more gracious, even if he were able to copy in his scrawl the
fine Roman hand of the concealed poet.&nbsp; I am surprised that
the Baconians have never made that point.&nbsp; Will&rsquo;s
&ldquo;copy&rdquo; was almost without blot or erasion, the other
actors were wont to boast.&nbsp; Really the absence of erasions
and corrections is too easily explained on the theory that Will
was <i>not</i> the author.&nbsp; Will merely copied the fair
copies handed to him by the concealed poet.&nbsp; The farce was
played for some twenty years, and was either undetected or all
concerned kept the dread secret&mdash;and all the other companies
and rival authors were concerned in exposing the imposture.</p>
<p>The whole story is like the dream of a child.&nbsp; We
therefore expect the Anti-Willians to endeavour to disable the
evidence of Jonson, Heywood, Heminge, and Condell.&nbsp; Their
attempts take the shape of the most extravagant and complex
conjectures; with certain petty objections to Ben&rsquo;s various
estimates of the <i>merits</i> of the <a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>plays.&nbsp; He is constant in his
witness to the authorship.&nbsp; To these efforts of despair we
return later, when we hope to justify what is here deliberately
advanced.</p>
<p>Meanwhile we study Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s attempts to destroy
or weaken the testimony of contemporary literary allusions, in
prose or verse, to the plays as the work of the actor.&nbsp; Mr.
Greenwood rests on an argument which perhaps could only have
occurred to legal minds, originally, perhaps to the mind of Judge
Webb, not in the prime vigour of his faculties.&nbsp; Not very
many literary allusions remain, made during Will&rsquo;s
life-time, to the plays of Shakespeare.&nbsp; The writers,
usually, speak of &ldquo;Shakespeare,&rdquo; or &ldquo;W.
Shakespeare,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Will Shakespeare,&rdquo; and leave
it there.&nbsp; In the same way, when they speak of other
contemporaries, they name them,&mdash;and leave it there, without
telling us &ldquo;who&rdquo; (Frank) Beaumont, or (Kit) Marlowe,
or (Robin) Greene, or (Jack) Fletcher, or any of the others
&ldquo;were.&rdquo;&nbsp; All interested readers knew who they
were: and also knew who &ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo; or &ldquo;Will
Shakespeare&rdquo; was.&nbsp; No other Will Shak(&amp;c.) was
prominently before the literary and dramatic world, in
1592&ndash;1616, except the Warwickshire provincial who played
with Burbage.</p>
<p>But though the mere names of the poets, Ben Jonson, Kit
Marlowe, Frank Beaumont, Harry Chettle, and so forth, are
accepted as indicating the well-known men whom they designate,
this <a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>evidence to identity does not satisfy Mr. Greenwood,
and the Baconians, where Will is concerned.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
should expect to find allusions to dramatic and poetical works
published under the name of &lsquo;Shakespeare&rsquo;; we should
expect to find Shakespeare spoken of as a poet and a dramatist;
we should expect, further, to find some few allusions to
Shakespeare or Shakspere the player.&nbsp; And these, of course,
we do find; but these are not the objects of our quest.&nbsp;
What we require is evidence to establish the identity of the
player with the poet and dramatist; to prove that the player was
the author of the <i>Plays</i> and <i>Poems</i>.&nbsp;
<i>That</i> is the proposition to be established, and <i>that</i>
the allusions fail, as it appears to me, to prove,&rdquo; says
Mr. Greenwood.&nbsp; He adds, &ldquo;At any rate they do not
disprove the theory that the true authorship was hidden under a
pseudonym&rdquo; <a name="citation136a"></a><a
href="#footnote136a" class="citation">[136a]</a>&mdash;which
raises an entirely different question.</p>
<p>Makers of allusions to the plays must identify Shakespeare
with the actor, explicitly; must tell us who this Shakespeare
was, though they need not, and usually do not, tell us who the
other authors mentioned were; and though the world of letters and
the Stage knew but one William Shakspere or Shakespeare, who was
far too familiar to them to require further identification.&nbsp;
But even if the makers of allusions did all this, and said,
&ldquo;by W. Shakespeare the poet, we mean W. Shakespeare the
actor&rdquo;&mdash;<i>that</i> is not enough.&nbsp; For <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>they may
all be deceived, may all believe that a bookless, untutored man
is the author.&nbsp; So we cannot get evidence correct enough for
Mr. Greenwood.</p>
<p>Destitute as I am of legal training, I leave this notable way
of disposing of the evidence to the judgement of the Bench and
the Bar, a layman intermeddleth not with it.&nbsp; Still, I am,
like other readers, on the Jury addressed,&mdash;I do not accept
the arguments.&nbsp; <i>Miror magis</i>, as Mr. Greenwood might
quote Latin.&nbsp; We have already seen one example of this
argument, when Heywood speaks of the author of poems by
Shakespeare, published in <i>The Passionate Pilgrim</i>.&nbsp;
Heywood does nothing to identify the actor Shakspere with the
author Shakespeare, says Mr. Greenwood.&nbsp; I shall prove that,
elsewhere, Heywood does identify them, and no man knew more of
the world of playwrights and actors than Heywood.&nbsp; I add
that in his remarks on <i>The Passionate Pilgrim</i>, Heywood had
no need to say &ldquo;by W. Shakespeare I mean the well-known
actor in the King&rsquo;s Company.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was no
other William Shakspere or Shakespeare known to his public.</p>
<p>It is to no purpose that Mr. Greenwood denies, as we have seen
above, that the allusions &ldquo;disprove the theory that the
true authorship was hidden under a pseudonym.&rdquo;&nbsp; That
is an entirely different question.&nbsp; He is now starting quite
another hare.&nbsp; Men of letters who alluded <a
name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>to the
plays and poems of William Shakespeare, meant the actor; that is
my position.&nbsp; That they may all have been mistaken: that
&ldquo;William Shakespeare&rdquo; was Bacon&rsquo;s, or any
one&rsquo;s pseudonym, is, I repeat, a wholly different question;
and we must not allow the critic to glide away into it through an
&ldquo;at any rate&rdquo;; as he does three or four times.&nbsp;
So far, then, Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s theory that it was impossible
for the actor Shakspere to have been the author of the plays,
encounters the difficulty that no contemporary attributed them to
any other hand: that none is known to have said, &ldquo;This
Warwickshire man cannot be the author.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us, however, examine some of these allusions to
Shakspere, real or supposed,&rdquo; says the critic. <a
name="citation138a"></a><a href="#footnote138a"
class="citation">[138a]</a>&nbsp; He begins with the hackneyed
words of the dying man of letters, Robert Greene, in <i>A
Groatsworth of Wit</i> (1592).&nbsp; The pamphlet is addressed to
Gentlemen of his acquaintance &ldquo;that spend their wits in
making plays&rdquo;; he &ldquo;wisheth them a better
exercise,&rdquo; and better fortunes than his own.&nbsp; (Marlowe
is supposed to be one of the three Gentlemen playwrights, but
such suppositions do not here concern us.)&nbsp; Greene&rsquo;s
is the ancient feud between the players and the authors, between
capital and labour.&nbsp; The players are the capitalists, and
buy the plays out and out,&mdash;cheap.&nbsp; The author has no
royalties; and no control over the future of his work, which a <a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>Shakspere
or a Bacon, a Jonson or a Chettle, or any handyman of the company
owning the play, may alter as he pleases.&nbsp; It is highly
probable that the actors also acquired most of the popular
renown, for, even now, playgoers have much to say about the
players in a piece, while they seldom know the name of the
playwright.&nbsp; Women fall in love with the actors, not with
the authors; but with &ldquo;those puppets,&rdquo; as Greene
says, &ldquo;that speake from our mouths, these anticks,
garnished in our colours.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ben Jonson, we shall see,
makes some of the same complaints,&mdash;most natural in the
circumstances: though he managed to retain the control of his
dramas; how, I do not know.&nbsp; Greene adds that in his
misfortunes, illness, and poverty, he is ungratefully
&ldquo;forsaken,&rdquo; by the players, and warns his friends
that such may be <i>their</i> lot; advising them to seek
&ldquo;some better exercise.&rdquo;&nbsp; He then
writes&mdash;and his meaning cannot easily be misunderstood, I
think, but misunderstood it has been&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, trust them
not&rdquo; (trust not the players), &ldquo;<span
class="GutSmall">FOR</span> there is an upstart crow, beautified
with our feathers, that with his <i>Tyger&rsquo;s heart wrapt in
a Player&rsquo;s hide</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;Player&rsquo;s&rdquo; in
place of &ldquo;woman&rsquo;s,&rdquo; in an old play, <i>The
Tragedy of Richard</i>, <i>Duke of York</i>, &amp;c.),
&ldquo;supposes he is as well able to bumbast out a blank verse
as the best of you; and being an absolute <i>Johannes
Factotum</i>, is in his own conceit the only Shake-scene in a
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The meaning is pellucid.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do not trust the <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>players, my
fellow playwrights, for the reasons already given, for they, in
addition to their glory gained by mouthing <i>our</i> words, and
their ingratitude, may now forsake you for one of themselves, a
player, who thinks his blank verse as good as the best of
yours&rdquo; (including Marlowe&rsquo;s, probably).&nbsp;
&ldquo;The man is ready at their call&rdquo; (&ldquo;an absolute
<i>Johannes Factotum</i>&rdquo;).&nbsp; &ldquo;In his own
conceit&rdquo; he is &ldquo;the only Shake-scene in a
country.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Seek you better masters,&rdquo; than
these players, who have now an author among themselves,
&ldquo;the only Shake-scene,&rdquo; where the pun on Shakespeare
does not look like a fortuitous coincidence.&nbsp; But it may be,
anything may happen.</p>
<p>The sense, I repeat, is pellucid.&nbsp; But Mr. Greenwood
writes that if Shake-scene be an allusion to Shakespeare
&ldquo;it seems clear that it is as an actor rather than as an
author he is attacked.&rdquo; <a name="citation140a"></a><a
href="#footnote140a" class="citation">[140a]</a>&nbsp; As an
<i>actor</i> the person alluded to is merely assailed with the
other actors, his &ldquo;fellows.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he is picked
out as presenting another and a new reason why authors should
distrust the players, &ldquo;<i>for</i> there is&rdquo; among
themselves, &ldquo;in a player&rsquo;s hide,&rdquo; &ldquo;an
upstart crow&rdquo;&mdash;who thinks his blank verse as good as
the best of theirs.&nbsp; He is, therefore, necessarily a
playwright, and being a <i>factotum</i>, can readily be employed
by the players to the prejudice of Greene&rsquo;s three friends,
who are professed playwrights.</p>
<p><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>Mr.
Greenwood says that &ldquo;we do not know why Greene should have
been so particularly bitter against the players, and why he
should have thought it necessary so seriously to warn his fellow
playwrights against them.&rdquo; <a name="citation141a"></a><a
href="#footnote141a" class="citation">[141a]</a>&nbsp; But we
cannot help knowing; for Greene has told us.&nbsp; In addition to
gaining renown solely through mouthing &ldquo;<i>our</i>&rdquo;
words, wearing &ldquo;<i>our</i> feathers,&rdquo; they have been
bitterly ungrateful to Greene in his poverty and sickness; they
will, in the same circumstances, as cruelly forsake his friends;
&ldquo;yes, for they now have&rdquo; an author, and to the
playwrights a dangerous rival, in their own fellowship.&nbsp;
Thus we know with absolute certainty why Greene wrote as he
did.&nbsp; He says nothing about the superior financial gains of
the players, which Mr. Greenwood suspects to have been the
&ldquo;only&rdquo; cause of his bitterness.&nbsp; Greene gives
its causes in the plainest possible terms, as did Ben Jonson
later, in his verses &ldquo;Poet-Ape&rdquo;
(Playwright-Actor).&nbsp; Moreover, Mr. Greenwood gives
Greene&rsquo;s obvious motives on the very page where he says
that we do not know them.</p>
<p>Even Mr. Greenwood, <a name="citation141b"></a><a
href="#footnote141b" class="citation">[141b]</a> anxious as he is
to prove Shake-scene to be attacked as an actor, admits that the
words &ldquo;supposes himself as well able to bumbast out a blank
verse as the best of you,&rdquo; &ldquo;do seem to have that
implication,&rdquo; <a name="citation141c"></a><a
href="#footnote141c" class="citation">[141c]</a> namely, that
&ldquo;Shake-scene&rdquo; is a dramatic author: <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>what else
can the words mean; why, if not for the Stage, should Shake-scene
write blank verse?</p>
<p>Finally Mr. Greenwood, after saying &ldquo;it is clear that it
is as an actor rather than as an author that
&lsquo;Shake-scene&rsquo; is attacked,&rdquo; <a
name="citation142a"></a><a href="#footnote142a"
class="citation">[142a]</a> concedes <a
name="citation142b"></a><a href="#footnote142b"
class="citation">[142b]</a> that it &ldquo;certainly looks as if
he&rdquo; (Greene) &ldquo;meant to suggest that this Shake-scene
supposed himself able to compose, as well as to mouth
verses.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nothing else can possibly be meant.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The rest of you&rdquo; were authors, not actors.</p>
<p>If not, why, in a whole company of actors, should
&ldquo;Shake-scene&rdquo; alone be selected for a special
victim?&nbsp; Shake-scene is chosen out because, as an author, a
factotum always ready at need, he is more apt than the professed
playwrights to be employed as author by his company: this is a
new reason for not trusting the players.</p>
<p>I am not going to take the trouble to argue as to whether, in
the circumstances of the case, &ldquo;Shake-scene&rdquo; is meant
by Greene for a pun on &ldquo;Shake-speare,&rdquo; or not.&nbsp;
If he had some other rising player-author, the Factotum of a cry
of players, in his mind, Baconians may search for that personage
in the records of the stage.&nbsp; That other player-author may
have died young, or faded into obscurity.&nbsp; The term
&ldquo;the only Shake-scene&rdquo; may be one of those curious
coincidences <a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>which do occur.&nbsp; The presumption lies rather on
the other side.&nbsp; I demur, when Mr. Greenwood courageously
struggling for his case says that, even assuming the validity of
the surmise that there is an allusion to Shakspere, <a
name="citation143a"></a><a href="#footnote143a"
class="citation">[143a]</a> &ldquo;the utmost that we should be
entitled to say is that Greene here accuses Player Shakspere of
putting forward, as his own, some work, or perhaps some parts of
a work, for which he was really indebted to another&rdquo; (the
Great Unknown?).&nbsp; I do more than demur, I defy any man to
exhibit that sense in Greene&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The utmost that we should be entitled to say,&rdquo;
is, in my opinion, what we have no shadow of a title to
say.&nbsp; Look at the poor hackneyed, tortured words of Greene
again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, trust them not; for there is an upstart
crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his
<i>Tyger&rsquo;s heart wrapped in a player&rsquo;s hide</i>,
supposes he is as well able to bumbast out a blank verse as the
best of you; and being an absolute <i>Johannes Factotum</i>, is
in his own conceit the only Shake-scene in a country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How can mortal man squeeze from these words the charge that
&ldquo;Player Shakspere&rdquo; is &ldquo;putting forward, as his
own, some work, or perhaps some parts of a work, for which he was
really indebted to another&rdquo;?&nbsp; It is as an actor, with
other actors, that the player is &ldquo;beautified with
<i>our</i> feathers,&rdquo;&mdash;not with the feathers of some
one <a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span><i>not</i> ourselves, Bacon or Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s
Unknown.&nbsp; Mr. Greenwood even says that Shake-scene is
referred to &ldquo;as beautified with the feathers <i>which he
has stolen</i> from the dramatic writers&rdquo; (&ldquo;our
feathers&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Greene says absolutely nothing about feathers &ldquo;<i>which
he has stolen</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The &ldquo;feathers,&rdquo; the
words of the plays, were bought, not stolen, by the actors,
&ldquo;anticks garnished in our colours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tedious it is to write many words about words so few and
simple as those of Greene; meaning &ldquo;do not trust the
players, for one of them writes blank verse which he thinks as
good as the best of yours, and fancies himself the only
Shake-scene in a country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But &ldquo;Greene here accuses Player Shakspere of putting
forward, as his own, some work, or perhaps some parts of a work,
for which he was really indebted to another,&rdquo; this is
&ldquo;the utmost we should be entitled to say,&rdquo; even if
the allusion be to Shakspere.&nbsp; How does Mr. Greenwood get
the Anti-Willian hypothesis out of Greene&rsquo;s few and plain
words?</p>
<p>It is much safer for him to say that &ldquo;Shake-scene&rdquo;
is not meant for Shakespeare.&nbsp; Nobody can prove that it
<i>is</i>; the pun <i>may</i> be a strange coincidence,&mdash;or
any one may say that he thinks it nothing more; if he
pleases.</p>
<p>Greene nowhere &ldquo;refers to this Shake-scene as being an
impostor, an upstart crow beautified with the feathers <i>which
he has stolen from the </i><a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span><i>dramatic writers</i> (&ldquo;our
feathers&rdquo;)&rdquo; <a name="citation145a"></a><a
href="#footnote145a" class="citation">[145a]</a>&mdash;that is,
Greene makes no such reference to Shake-scene in his capacity of
writer of blank verse.&nbsp; Like all players, who are all
&ldquo;anticks garnisht in our colours,&rdquo; Shake-scene, <i>as
player</i>, is &ldquo;beautified with our feathers.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It is Mr. Greenwood who adds &ldquo;beautified with the feathers
which he has <i>stolen</i> from the dramatic
writers.&rdquo;&nbsp; Greene does not even remotely hint at
plagiarism on the part of Shake-scene: and the feathers, the
plays of Greene and his friends, were not stolen but
bought.&nbsp; We must take Greene&rsquo;s evidence as we find
it,&mdash;it proves that by &ldquo;Shake-scene&rdquo; he means a
&ldquo;poet-ape,&rdquo; a playwright-actor; for Greene, like
Jonson, speaks of actors as &ldquo;apes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Both men
saw in a certain actor and dramatist a suspected rival.&nbsp;
Only one such successful practising actor-playwright is known to
us at this date (1592&ndash;1601),&mdash;and he is
Shakespeare.&nbsp; Unless another such existed, Greene, in 1592,
alludes to William Shak(&amp;c.) as a player and
playwright.&nbsp; This proves that the actor from Stratford was
accepted in Greene&rsquo;s world as an author of plays in blank
verse.&nbsp; He cannot, therefore, have seemed incapable of his
poetry.</p>
<p>Let us now briefly consider other contemporary allusions to
Shakespeare selected by Mr. Greenwood himself.&nbsp; No allusion
can prove that Shakespeare was the author of the work attributed
to him in the allusions.&nbsp; The plays and poems <i>may</i>
have <a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>been by James VI and I, &ldquo;a
parcel-poet.&rdquo;&nbsp; The allusions can prove no more than
that, by his contemporaries, Shakespeare was believed to be the
poet, which is impossible if he were a mere rustic ignoramus, as
the Baconians aver.&nbsp; Omitting some remarks by Chettle on
Greene&rsquo;s <i>Groatsworth of Wit</i>, <a
name="citation146a"></a><a href="#footnote146a"
class="citation">[146a]</a> as, if grammar goes for all, they do
not refer to Shakespeare, we have the Cambridge farce or comedy
on contemporary literature, the <i>Return from Parnassus</i>
(1602?).&nbsp; The University wits laugh at
Shakespeare,&mdash;not an university man, as the favourite poet,
in his <i>Venus and Adonis</i>, of a silly braggart pretender to
literature, Gullio.</p>
<p>They also introduce Kempe, the low comedy man of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s company, speaking to Burbage, the chief
tragic actor, of Shakespeare as a member of their company, who,
<i>as an author of plays</i>, &ldquo;puts down&rdquo; the
University wits &ldquo;and Ben Jonson too.&rdquo;&nbsp; The date
is not earlier than that of Ben&rsquo;s satiric play on the
poets, <i>The Poetaster</i> (1601), to which reference is
made.&nbsp; Since Kempe is to be represented as wholly ignorant,
his opinion of Shakespeare&rsquo;s pre-eminent merit only proves,
as in the case of Gullio, that the University wits decried the
excellences of Shakespeare.&nbsp; In him they saw no scholar.</p>
<p>The point is that Kempe recognises Shakespeare as both actor
and author.</p>
<p>All this &ldquo;is quite consistent with the theory <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>that
Shake-speare was a pseudonym,&rdquo; <a
name="citation147a"></a><a href="#footnote147a"
class="citation">[147a]</a> says Mr. Greenwood.&nbsp; Of course
it is, but it is <i>not</i> consistent with the theory that
Shakespeare was an uneducated, bookless rustic, for, in that
case, his mask would have fallen off in a day, in an hour.&nbsp;
Of course the Cambridge author only proves, if you will, that
<i>he</i> thought that <i>Kempe</i> thought, that his fellow
player was the author.&nbsp; But we have better evidence of what
the actors thought than in the Cambridge play.</p>
<p>In 1598, as we saw, Francis Meres in <i>Palladis Tamia</i>
credits Shakespeare with <i>Venus and Adonis</i>, with privately
circulated sonnets, and with a number of the comedies and
tragedies.&nbsp; How the allusions &ldquo;negative the hypothesis
that Shakespeare was a <i>nom de plume</i> is not
apparent,&rdquo; says Mr. Greenwood, always constant to his
method.&nbsp; I repeat that he wanders from the point, which is,
here, that the only William Shak(&amp;c.) known to us at the
time, in London, was credited with the plays and poems on all
sides, which proves that no incompatibility between the man and
the works was recognised.</p>
<p>Then Weaver (1599) alludes to him as author of <i>Venus</i>,
<i>Lucrece</i>, <i>Romeo</i>, <i>Richard</i>, &ldquo;more whose
names I know not.&rdquo;&nbsp; Davies (1610) calls him &ldquo;our
English Terence&rdquo; (the famous comedian), and mentions him as
having &ldquo;played some Kingly parts in sport.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Freeman (1614) credits him with <i>Venus</i> and
<i>Lucrece</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Besides in <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>plays thy
wit winds like Meander.&rdquo;&nbsp; I repeat Heywood&rsquo;s
evidence.&nbsp; Thomas Heywood, author of that remarkable
domestic play, <i>A Woman Killed with Kindness</i>, was, from the
old days of Henslowe, in the fifteen-nineties, a playwright and
an actor; he survived into the reign of Charles I.&nbsp; Writing
on the familiar names of the poets, &ldquo;Jack Fletcher,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Frank Beaumont,&rdquo; &ldquo;Kit Marlowe,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Tom Nash,&rdquo; he says,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mellifluous Shakespeare whose enchanting
quill<br />
Commanded mirth and passion, was but
&lsquo;Will.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does Heywood not identify the actor with the author?&nbsp; No
quibbles serve against the evidence.</p>
<p>We need not pursue the allusions later than
Shakespeare&rsquo;s death, or invoke, at present, Ben
Jonson&rsquo;s panegyric of 1623.&nbsp; As to Davies, his dull
and obscure epigram is addressed &ldquo;To our English Terence,
Mr. Will Shake-speare.&rdquo;&nbsp; He accosts Shakespeare as
&ldquo;Good Will.&rdquo;&nbsp; He remarks that, &ldquo;as some
say,&rdquo; if Will &ldquo;had not played some Kingly parts in
sport,&rdquo; he had been &ldquo;a companion for a
<i>King</i>,&rdquo; and &ldquo;been a King among the meaner
sort.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nobody, now, can see the allusion and the
joke.&nbsp; Shakespeare&rsquo;s company, in 1604, acted a play on
the Gowrie Conspiracy of 1600.&nbsp; King James suppressed the
play after the second night, as, of course, he was brought on the
stage throughout the action: and in very droll and dreadful
situations.&nbsp; Did Will take the <a name="page149"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>King&rsquo;s part, and annoy gentle
King Jamie, &ldquo;as some say&rdquo;?&nbsp; Nobody knows.&nbsp;
But Mr. Greenwood, to disable Davies&rsquo;s recognition of Mr.
Will as a playwright, &ldquo;Our English Terence,&rdquo; quotes,
from Florio&rsquo;s <i>Montaigne</i>, a silly old piece of Roman
literary gossip, Terence&rsquo;s plays were written by Scipio and
Laelius.&nbsp; In fact, Terence alludes in his prologue to the
<i>Adelphi</i>, to a spiteful report that he was aided by great
persons.&nbsp; The prologue may be the source of the
fable&mdash;that does not matter.&nbsp; Davies might get the
fable in Montaigne, and, knowing that some Great One wrote
Will&rsquo;s plays, might therefore, in irony, address him as
&ldquo;Our English Terence.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is a pretty free
conjecture!&nbsp; In Roman comedy he had only two names known to
him to choose from; he took Terence, not Plautus.&nbsp; But if
Davies was in the great Secret, a world of others must have
shared <i>le Secret de Polichinelle</i>.&nbsp; Yet none hints at
it, and only a very weak cause could catch at so tiny a straw as
the off-chance that Davies <i>knew</i>, and used
&ldquo;Terence&rdquo; as a gibe. <a name="citation149a"></a><a
href="#footnote149a" class="citation">[149a]</a></p>
<p>The allusions, even the few selected, cannot prove that the
actor wrote the plays, but do prove that he was believed to have
done so, and therefore that he was not so ignorant and bookless
as to demonstrate that he was incapable of the poetry and the
knowledge displayed in his <a name="page150"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 150</span>works.&nbsp; Mr. Greenwood himself
observes that a Baconian critic goes too far when he makes Will
incapable of writing.&nbsp; Such a Will could deceive no mortal.
<a name="citation150a"></a><a href="#footnote150a"
class="citation">[150a]</a>&nbsp; But does Mr. Greenwood, who
finds in the Author of the plays &ldquo;much learning, and
remarkable classical attainments,&rdquo; or &ldquo;a wide
familiarity with the classics,&rdquo; <a
name="citation150b"></a><a href="#footnote150b"
class="citation">[150b]</a> suppose that his absolutely bookless
Will could have persuaded his intimates that he was the author of
plays exhibiting &ldquo;a wide familiarity with the
classics,&rdquo; or &ldquo;remarkable classical
attainments.&rdquo;&nbsp; The thing is wholly impossible.</p>
<p>I do not remember that a single contemporary allusion to
Shakespeare speaks of him as &ldquo;learned,&rdquo; erudite,
scholarly, and so forth.&nbsp; The epithets for him are
&ldquo;sweet,&rdquo; &ldquo;gentle,&rdquo; &ldquo;honeyed,&rdquo;
&ldquo;sugared,&rdquo; &ldquo;honey-tongued&rdquo;&mdash;this is
the convention.&nbsp; The tradition followed by Milton, who was
eight years of age when Shakespeare died, and who wrote
<i>L&rsquo;Allegro</i> just after leaving Cambridge, makes
Shakespeare &ldquo;sweetest Shakespeare, Fancy&rsquo;s
child,&rdquo; with &ldquo;native wood-notes wild&rdquo;; and
gives to Jonson &ldquo;the <i>learned</i> sock.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Fuller, like Milton, was born eight years before the death of
Shakespeare, namely, in 1608.&nbsp; Like Milton he was a
Cambridge man.&nbsp; The First Folio of Shakespeare&rsquo;s works
appeared when each of these two bookish men was aged
fifteen.&nbsp; It would necessarily revive interest in
Shakespeare, now <a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>first known as far as about half of his plays went: he
would be discussed among lovers of literature at Cambridge.&nbsp;
Mr. Greenwood quotes Fuller&rsquo;s remark that
Shakespeare&rsquo;s &ldquo;learning was very little,&rdquo; that,
if alive, he would confess himself &ldquo;to be never any
scholar.&rdquo; <a name="citation151a"></a><a
href="#footnote151a" class="citation">[151a]</a>&nbsp; I cannot
grant that Fuller is dividing the persons of actor and
author.&nbsp; Men of Shakespeare&rsquo;s generation, such as
Jonson, did not think him learned; nor did men of the next
generation.&nbsp; If Mr. Collins&rsquo;s view be correct, the men
of Shakespeare&rsquo;s and of Milton&rsquo;s generations were too
ignorant to perceive that Shakespeare was deeply learned in the
literature of Rome, and in the literature of Greece.&nbsp; Every
one was too ignorant, till Mr. Collins came.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">&ldquo;THE SILENCE OF PHILIP
HENSLOWE&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Shakespeare is mentioned as an
author by contemporary writers, the Baconian stratagem, we have
seen, is to cry, &ldquo;Ah, but you cannot prove the author
mentioned to be the actor.&rdquo;&nbsp; We have seen that Meres
(1598) speaks of Shakespeare as the leading tragic and comic poet
(&ldquo;Poor poet-ape that would be thought our chief,&rdquo;
quoth Jonson), as author of <i>Venus and Adonis</i>, and as a
sonneteer.&nbsp; &ldquo;All this does nothing whatever to support
the idea that the Stratford player was the author of the plays
and poems alluded to,&rdquo; says Mr. Greenwood, playing that
card again. <a name="citation155a"></a><a href="#footnote155a"
class="citation">[155a]</a></p>
<p>The allusions, I repeat, <i>do</i> prove that Shak(&amp;c.),
the actor, was believed to be the author, till any other noted
William Shak(&amp;c.) is found to have been conspicuously before
the town.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is nothing at all to prove that
Meres, native of Lincolnshire, had any personal knowledge of
Shakespeare.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is nothing at all to prove that
Meres, native of Lincolnshire, had any personal knowledge of
nine-tenths of the English authors, famous or forgotten, whom he
<a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>mentions.&nbsp; &ldquo;On the question&mdash;who was
Shakespeare?&mdash;he throws no light.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
&ldquo;throws no light on the question&rdquo; &ldquo;who
was?&rdquo; any of the poets mentioned by him, except one, quite
forgotten, whose College he names . . . To myself this &ldquo;sad
repeated air,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;critics who praise Shakespeare
do not say <i>who Shakespeare</i> was,&rdquo;&mdash;would appear
to be, not an argument, but a subterfuge: though Mr. Greenwood
honestly believes it to be an argument,&mdash;otherwise he would
not use it: much less would he repeat it with frequent
iteration.&nbsp; The more a man was notorious, as was Will
Shakspere the actor, the less the need for any critic to tell his
public &ldquo;who Shakespeare was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Mr. Greenwood tries to disable the evidence when
Shakespeare is alluded to as an author, so he tries to better his
case when, in the account-book of Philip Henslowe, an owner of
theatres, money-lender, pawn-broker, purchaser of plays from
authors, and so forth, Shakespeare is <i>not</i> mentioned at
all.&nbsp; Here is a mystery which, properly handled, may advance
the great cause.&nbsp; Henslowe has notes of loans of money to
several actors, some of them of Shakespeare&rsquo;s company,
&ldquo;The Lord Chamberlain&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is no
such note of a loan to Shakespeare.&nbsp; Does this prove that he
was not an actor?&nbsp; If so, Burbage was not an actor; Henslowe
never names him.</p>
<p>There are notes of payments of money to Henslowe after each
performance of any play in one of his theatres.&nbsp; In these
notes <i>the name of Shakespeare </i><a name="page157"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 157</span><i>is never once mentioned as the
author of any play</i>.&nbsp; How weird!&nbsp; But in
<i>these</i> notes the names of the authors of the plays acted
are never mentioned.&nbsp; Does this suggest that Bacon wrote all
these plays?</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are frequent mentions of advances of
money to authors who were working at plays for Henslowe, singly,
or in pairs, threes, fours, or fives.&nbsp; We find Drayton,
Dekker, Chapman, and nine authors now forgotten by all but
antiquarians.&nbsp; We have also Ben Jonson (1597), Marston,
Munday, Middleton, Webster, and others, authors in
Henslowe&rsquo;s pay.&nbsp; <i>But the same of Shakespeare never
appears</i>.&nbsp; Mysterious!&nbsp; The other men&rsquo;s names,
writes Dr. Furness, occur &ldquo;because they were all writers
for Henslowe&rsquo;s theatre, but we must wait at all events for
the discovery of some other similar record, before we can produce
corresponding memoranda regarding Shaksper&rdquo; (<i>sic</i>)
&ldquo;and his productions.&rdquo; <a name="citation157a"></a><a
href="#footnote157a" class="citation">[157a]</a></p>
<p>The natural mind of the ordinary man explains all by saying,
&ldquo;Henslowe records no loans of money to Shakspere the actor,
because he lent him no money.&nbsp; He records no payments for
plays to Shakespeare the author-actor, because to Henslowe the
actor sold no plays.&rdquo;&nbsp; That is the whole explanation
of the Silence of Philip Henslowe.&nbsp; If Shakspere did sell a
play to Henslowe, why should that financier omit the fact from
his accounts?&nbsp; Suppose that the actor was illiterate <a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>as
Baconians fervently believe, and sold Bacon&rsquo;s plays, what
prevented him from selling a play of Bacon&rsquo;s (under his own
name, as usual) to Henslowe?&nbsp; To obtain a Baconian reply you
must wander into conjecture, and imagine that Bacon forbade the
transaction.&nbsp; Then <i>why</i> did he forbid it?&nbsp;
Because he could get a better price from Shakspere&rsquo;s
company?&nbsp; The same cause would produce the same effect on
Shakspere himself; whether he were the author, or were
Bacon&rsquo;s, or any man&rsquo;s go-between.&nbsp; On any score
but that of money, why was Henslowe good enough for Ben Jonson,
Dekker, Heywood, Middleton, and Webster, and not good enough for
Bacon, who did not appear in the matter at all, but was
represented in it by the actor, Will?&nbsp; As a gentleman and a
man of the Court, Bacon would be as much discredited if he were
known to sell (for &pound;6 on an average) his noble works to the
Lord Chamberlain&rsquo;s Company, as if he sold them to
Henslowe.</p>
<p>I know not whether the great lawyer, courtier, scholar, and
philosopher is supposed by Baconians to have given Will Shakspere
a commission on his sales of plays; or to have let him keep the
whole sum in each case.&nbsp; I know not whether the players paid
Shakspere a sum down for his (or Bacon&rsquo;s) plays, or whether
Will received a double share, or other, or any share of the
profits on them, as Henslowe did when he let a house to the
players.&nbsp; Nobody knows any of these things.</p>
<p><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>&ldquo;If Shakspere the player had been a dramatist,
surely Henslowe would have employed him also, like the others, in
that behalf.&rdquo; <a name="citation159a"></a><a
href="#footnote159a" class="citation">[159a]</a>&nbsp; Henslowe
would, if he could have got the &ldquo;copy&rdquo; cheap
enough.&nbsp; Was any one of &ldquo;the others,&rdquo; the
playwrights, a player, holding a share in his company?&nbsp; If
not, the fact makes an essential difference, for Shakspere
<i>was</i> a shareholder.&nbsp; Collier, in his preface to
Henslowe&rsquo;s so-called &ldquo;Diary,&rdquo; mentions a
playwright who was bound to scribble for Henslowe only (Henry
Porter), and another, Chettle, who was bound to write only for
the company protected by the Earl of Nottingham. <a
name="citation159b"></a><a href="#footnote159b"
class="citation">[159b]</a>&nbsp; Modern publishers and managers
sometimes make the same terms with novelists and playwrights.</p>
<p>It appears to me that Shakspere&rsquo;s company would be
likely, as his plays were very popular, to make the same sort of
agreement with him, and to give him such terms as he would be
glad to accept,&mdash;whether the wares were his own&mdash;or
Bacon&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He was a keen man of business.&nbsp; In such
a case, he would not write for Henslowe&rsquo;s pittance.&nbsp;
He had a better market.&nbsp; The plays, whether written by
himself, or Bacon, or the Man in the Moon, were at his disposal,
and he did not dispose of them to Henslowe, wherefore Henslowe
cannot mention him in his accounts.&nbsp; That is all.</p>
<p><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>Quoting an American Judge (Dr. Stotsenburg,
apparently), Mr. Greenwood cites the circumstance that, in two
volumes of Alleyn&rsquo;s papers &ldquo;there is not one mention
of such a poet as William Shaksper in his list of actors, poets,
and theatrical comrades.&rdquo; <a name="citation160a"></a><a
href="#footnote160a" class="citation">[160a]</a>&nbsp; If this
means that Shakspere is not mentioned by Alleyn among actors, are
we to infer that William was not an actor?&nbsp; Even Baconians
insist that he was an actor.&nbsp; &ldquo;How strange, how more
than strange,&rdquo; cries Mr. Greenwood, &ldquo;that Henslowe
should make no mention in all this long diary, embracing all the
time from 1591 to 1609, of the actor-author . . . No
matter.&nbsp; <i>Credo quia impossibile</i>!&rdquo; <a
name="citation160b"></a><a href="#footnote160b"
class="citation">[160b]</a>&nbsp; <i>Credo</i> what? and what is
<i>impossible</i>?&nbsp; Henslowe&rsquo;s volume is no Diary; he
does not tell a single anecdote of any description; he merely
enters loans, gains, payments.&nbsp; Does Henslowe mention, say,
Ben Jonson, <i>when he is not doing business with Ben</i>?&nbsp;
Does he mention any actor or author except in connection with
money matters?&nbsp; Then, if he did no business with Shakspere
the actor, in borrowing or lending, and did no business with
Shakespeare the author, in borrowing, lending, buying or selling,
&ldquo;How strange, how more than strange&rdquo; it would be if
Henslowe <i>did</i> mention Shakespeare!&nbsp; He was not keeping
a journal of literary and dramatic jottings.&nbsp; He was keeping
an account of his expenses <a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>and receipts.&nbsp; He never names
Richard Burbage any more than he mentions Shakespeare.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood again expresses his views about this dark
suspicious mystery, the absence of Shakespeare or Shakspere (or
Shak, as you like it), from Henslowe&rsquo;s accounts, if
Shak(&amp;c.) wrote plays.&nbsp; But the mystery, if mystery
there be, is just as obscure if the actor were the channel
through which Bacon&rsquo;s plays reached the stage, for the
pretended author of these masterpieces.&nbsp; Shak&mdash;was not
the man to do all the troking, bargaining, lying, going here and
there, and making himself a motley to the view for &pound;0,
0<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i>&nbsp; If he were a sham, a figure-head, a
liar, a fetcher-and-carrier of manuscripts, <i>he would be paid
for it</i>.&nbsp; But he did not deal with Henslowe in his
bargainings, and <i>that</i> is why Henslowe does not mention
him.&nbsp; Mr. Greenwood, in one place, <a
name="citation161a"></a><a href="#footnote161a"
class="citation">[161a]</a> agrees, so far, with me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why did Henslowe not mention Shakespeare as the writer of
other plays&rdquo; (than <i>Titus Andronicus</i> and <i>Henry
VI</i>)?&nbsp; &ldquo;I think the answer is simple
enough.&rdquo;&nbsp; (So do I.)&nbsp; &ldquo;Neither Shakspere
nor &lsquo;Shakespeare&rsquo; ever wrote for
Henslowe!&rdquo;&nbsp; The obvious is perceived at last; and the
reason given is &ldquo;that he was above Henslowe&rsquo;s
&lsquo;skyline,&rsquo;&rdquo; &ldquo;he&rdquo; being the
Author.&nbsp; We only differ as to <i>why</i> the author was
above Henslowe&rsquo;s &ldquo;sky-line.&rdquo;&nbsp; I say,
because good Will had a better market, that of his Company.&nbsp;
I understand <a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>Mr. Greenwood to think,&mdash;because the Great Unknown
was too great a man to deal with Henslowe.&nbsp; If to write for
the stage were discreditable, to deal (unknown) with Henslowe was
no more disgraceful than to deal with &ldquo;a cry of
players&rdquo;; and as (unknown) Will did the bargaining, the
Great Unknown was as safe with Will in one case as in the
other.&nbsp; If Will did not receive anything for the plays from
his own company (who firmly believed in his authorship), they
must have said, &ldquo;Will! dost thou serve the Muses and thy
obliged fellows for naught?&nbsp; Dost thou give us two popular
plays yearly,&mdash;gratis?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do you not see that, in the interests of the Great Secret
itself, Will <i>had</i> to take the pay for the plays (pretended
his) from somebody.&nbsp; Will Shakspere making his dear fellows
and friends a present of two masterpieces yearly was too
incredible.&nbsp; So I suppose he did have royalties on the
receipts, or otherwise got his money; and, as he certainly did
not get them from Henslowe, Henslowe had no conceivable reason
for entering Will&rsquo;s name in his accounts.</p>
<p>Such are the reflections of a plain man, but to an imaginative
soul there seems to be a brooding mist, with a heart of fire,
which half conceals and half reveals the darkened chamber wherein
abides &ldquo;The Silence of Philip Henslowe.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;The Silence of Philip Henslowe,&rdquo; Mr. Greenwood
writes, &ldquo;is a very remarkable phenomenon . . .
&rdquo;&nbsp; It is a phenomenon <a name="page163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>precisely as remarkable as the
absence of Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s name from the accounts of a
boot-maker with whom he has never had any dealings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If, however, there was a man in high position, &lsquo;a
concealed poet,&rsquo;&rdquo; who &ldquo;took the works of others
and rewrote and transformed them, besides bringing out original
plays of his own . . . then it is natural enough that his name
should not appear among those [of the] for the most part
impecunious dramatists to whom Henslowe paid money for
playwriting.&rdquo; <a name="citation163a"></a><a
href="#footnote163a" class="citation">[163a]</a>&nbsp; Nothing
can be more natural, and, in fact, the name of Bacon, or
Southampton, or James VI, or Sir John Ramsay, or Sir Walter
Raleigh, or Sir Fulke Greville, or any other &ldquo;man in high
position,&rdquo; does <i>not</i> appear in Henslowe&rsquo;s
accounts.&nbsp; Nor does the name of William Shak(&amp;c.).&nbsp;
But why should it not appear if Will sold either his own plays,
or those of the noble friend to whom he lent his name and
personality&mdash;to Henslowe?&nbsp; Why not?</p>
<p>Then consider the figure, to my mind impossible, of the great
&ldquo;concealed poet&rdquo; &ldquo;of high position,&rdquo; who
can &ldquo;bring out original plays of his own,&rdquo; and yet
&ldquo;takes the works of others,&rdquo; say of &ldquo;sporting
Kyd,&rdquo; or of Dekker and Chettle, and such poor
devils,&mdash;<i>takes</i> them as a Yankee pirate-publisher
takes my rhymes,&mdash;and &ldquo;rewrites and transforms
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bacon (or Bungay) <i>cannot</i> &ldquo;take&rdquo; them
without permission of their legal owners,&mdash;Shakspere&rsquo;s
<a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>or any
other company;&mdash;of any one, in short, who, as Ben Jonson
says, &ldquo;buys up reversions of old plays.&rdquo;&nbsp; How is
he to manage these shabby dealings?&nbsp; Apparently he employs
Will Shakspere, spells his own &ldquo;<i>nom de plume</i>&rdquo;
&ldquo;Shakespeare,&rdquo; and has his rewritings and
transformations of the destitute author&rsquo;s work acted by
Will&rsquo;s company.&nbsp; What a situation for Bacon, or Sir
Fulke Greville, or James VI, or any &ldquo;man in high
position&rdquo; whom fancy can suggest!&nbsp; The plays by the
original authors, whoever they were, could only be obtained by
the &ldquo;concealed poet&rdquo; and &ldquo;man in high
position&rdquo; from the legal owners, Shakspere&rsquo;s company,
usually.&nbsp; The concealed poet had to negotiate with the
owners, and Bacon (or whoever he was) employed that scamp Will
Shakspere, first, I think, to extract the plays from the owners,
and then to pretend that he himself, even Will, had
&ldquo;rewritten and transformed them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What an associate was our Will for the concealed poet; how
certain it was that Will would blackmail the &ldquo;man in high
position&rdquo;!&nbsp; &ldquo;Doubtless&rdquo; he did: we find
Bacon arrested for debt, more than once, while Will buys New
Place, in Stratford, with the money extorted from the concealed
poet of high position. <a name="citation164a"></a><a
href="#footnote164a" class="citation">[164a]</a>&nbsp; Bacon did
associate with that serpent Phillips, a reptile of Walsingham,
who forged a postscript to Mary Stuart&rsquo;s letter to
Babington.&nbsp; But now, if not Bacon, then some other concealed
poet of high position, with a <a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>mysterious passion for rewriting and
transforming plays by sad, needy authors, is in close contact
with Will Shakspere, the Warwickshire poacher and ignorant
butcher&rsquo;s boy, country schoolmaster, draper&rsquo;s
apprentice, <i>enfin</i>, <i>tout le tremblement</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strange, how more than strange!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sum of the matter seems to me to be that from as early as
March 3, 1591, we find Henslowe receiving small sums of money for
the performances of many plays.&nbsp; He was paid as owner or
lessee of the House used by this or that company.&nbsp; On March
3, 1591, the play acted by &ldquo;Lord Strange&rsquo;s
(Derby&rsquo;s) men&rdquo; was <i>Henry VI</i>.&nbsp; Several
other plays with names familiar in Shakespeare&rsquo;s Works,
such as <i>Titus Andronicus</i>, all the three parts of <i>Henry
VI</i>, <i>King Leare</i> (April 6, 1593), <i>Henry V</i> (May
14, 1592), <i>The Taming of a Shrew</i> (June 11, 1594), and
<i>Hamlet</i>, paid toll to Henslowe.&nbsp; He
&ldquo;received&rdquo; so much, on each occasion, when they were
acted in a theatre of his.&nbsp; But he never records his
purchase of these plays; and it is not generally believed that
Shakespeare was the author of all these plays, in the form which
they bore in 1591&ndash;4: though there is much difference of
opinion.</p>
<p>There is one rather interesting case.&nbsp; On August 25,
1594, Henslowe enters &ldquo;<i>ne</i>&rdquo; (that is, &ldquo;a
new play&rdquo;) &ldquo;Received at the Venesyon Comodey,
eighteen pence.&rdquo;&nbsp; That was his share of the
receipts.&nbsp; The Lord Chamberlain&rsquo;s Company, <a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>that of
Shakespeare, was playing in Henslowe&rsquo;s theatre at Newington
Butts.&nbsp; If the &ldquo;Venesyon Comodey&rdquo; (Venetian
Comedy) were <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>, this is the first
mention of it.&nbsp; But nobody knows what Henslowe meant by
&ldquo;the Venesyon Comodey.&rdquo;&nbsp; He does not mention the
author&rsquo;s name, because, in this part of his accounts he
never does mention the author or authors.&nbsp; He only names
them when he buys from, or lends to, or has other money dealings
with the authors.&nbsp; He had none with Shakespeare, hence the
Silence of Philip Henslowe.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE LATER LIFE OF SHAKESPEARE&mdash;HIS
MONUMENT AND PORTRAITS</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the chapter on the
Preoccupations of Bacon the reader may find help in making up his
mind as to whether Bacon, with his many and onerous duties and
occupations, his scientific studies, and his absorbing scientific
preoccupation, is a probable author of the Shakespearean
plays.&nbsp; Mr. Greenwood finds the young Shakspere
impossible&mdash;because of his ignorance&mdash;which made him
such a really good pseudo-author, and such a successful mask for
Bacon, or Bacon&rsquo;s unknown equivalent.&nbsp; The Shakspere
of later life, the well-to-do Shakspere, the purchaser of the
right to bear arms; so bad at paying one debt at least; so eager
a creditor; a would-be encloser of a common; a man totally
bookless, is, to Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s mind, an impossible author
of the later plays.</p>
<p>Here, first, are moral objections on the ground of character
as revealed in some legal documents concerning business.&nbsp;
Now, I am very ready to confess that William&rsquo;s dealings
with his debtors, and with one creditor, are wholly unlike what I
should expect from the author of the plays.&nbsp; Moreover, <a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>the conduct
of Shelley in regard to his wife was, in my opinion, very mean
and cruel, and the last thing that we could have expected from
one who, in verse, was such a tender philanthropist, and in life
was&mdash;women apart&mdash;the best-hearted of men.&nbsp; The
conduct of Robert Burns, alas, too often disappoints the lover of
his <i>Cottar&rsquo;s Saturday Night</i> and other moral
pieces.&nbsp; He was an inconsistent walker.</p>
<p>I sincerely wish that Shakespeare had been less hard in money
matters, just as I wish that in financial matters Scott had been
more like himself, that he had not done the last things that we
should have expected him to do.&nbsp; As a member of the Scottish
Bar it was inconsistent with his honour to be the secret
proprietor of a publishing and a printing business.&nbsp; This is
the unexplained moral paradox in the career of a man of
chivalrous honour and strict probity: but the fault did not
prevent Scott from writing his novels and poems.&nbsp; Why, then,
should the few bare records of Shakspere&rsquo;s monetary
transactions make <i>his</i> authorship impossible?&nbsp; The
objection seems weakly sentimental.</p>
<p>Macaulay scolds Scott as fiercely as Mr. Greenwood scolds
Shakspere,&mdash;for the more part, ignorantly and
unjustly.&nbsp; Still, there is matter to cause surprise and
regret.&nbsp; Both Scott and Shakspere are accused of writing for
gain, and of spending money on lands and houses with the desire
to found families.&nbsp; But in the mysterious <a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>mixture of
each human personality, any sober soul who reflects on his own
sins and failings will not think other men&rsquo;s failings
incompatible with intellectual excellence.&nbsp; Bacon&rsquo;s
own conduct in money matters was that of a man equally grasping
and extravagant.&nbsp; Ben Jonson thus describes Shakespeare as a
social character: &ldquo;He was indeed honest, and of an open and
free nature . . . I loved the man and do honour his memory on
this side idolatry as much as any.&rdquo;&nbsp; Perhaps Ben never
owed money to Shakspere and refused to pay!</p>
<p>We must not judge a man&rsquo;s whole intellectual character,
and declare him to be incapable of poetry, on the score of a few
legal papers about matters of business.&nbsp; Apparently
Shakspere helped that Elizabethan Mr. Micawber, his father, out
of a pecuniary slough of despond, in which the ex-High Bailiff of
the town was floundering,&mdash;pursued by the distraint of one
of the friendly family of Quiney&mdash;Adrian Quiney.&nbsp; They
were neighbours and made a common dunghill in Henley Street. <a
name="citation171a"></a><a href="#footnote171a"
class="citation">[171a]</a>&nbsp; I do not, like Mr. Greenwood,
see anything &ldquo;at all out of the way&rdquo; in the
circumstance &ldquo;that a man should be writing <i>Hamlet</i>,
and at the same time bringing actions for petty sums lent on loan
at some unspecified interest.&rdquo; <a
name="citation171b"></a><a href="#footnote171b"
class="citation">[171b]</a>&nbsp; Nor do I see anything at all
out of the way in Bacon&rsquo;s prosecution of his friend and
benefactor, <a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>Essex (1601), while Bacon was writing
<i>Hamlet</i>.&nbsp; Indeed, Shakspere&rsquo;s case is the less
&ldquo;out of the way&rdquo; of the two.&nbsp; He wanted his loan
to be repaid, and told his lawyer to bring an action.&nbsp; Bacon
wanted to keep his head (of inestimable value) on his shoulders;
or to keep his body out of the Tower; or he merely, as he
declares, wanted to do his duty as a lawyer of the Crown.&nbsp;
In any case, Bacon was in a tragic position almost unexampled;
and was at once overwhelmed by work, and, one must suppose, by
acute distress of mind, in the case of Essex.&nbsp; He must have
felt this the more keenly, if, as some Baconians vow, <i>he wrote
the Sonnets to Essex</i>.&nbsp; Whether he were writing his
<i>Hamlet</i> when engaged in Essex&rsquo;s case (1601), or any
other of his dramatic masterpieces, even this astonishing man
must have been sorely bestead to combine so many branches of
business.</p>
<p>Thus I would reply to Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s amazement that
Shakspere, a hard creditor, and so forth, should none the less
have been able to write his plays.&nbsp; But if it is meant that
a few business transactions must have absorbed the whole
consciousness of Shakespeare, and left him neither time nor
inclination for poetry, consider the scientific preoccupation of
Bacon, his parliamentary duties, his ceaseless activity as
&ldquo;one of the legal body-guard of the Queen&rdquo; at a time
when he had often to be examining persons accused of
conspiracy,&mdash;and do not forget his long and <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>poignant
anxiety about Essex, his constant efforts to reconcile him with
Elizabeth, and to advocate his cause without losing her favour;
and, finally, the anguish of prosecuting his friend, and of
knowing how hardly the world judged his own conduct.&nbsp; Follow
him into his relations with James I; his eager pursuit of favour,
the multiplicity of his affairs, his pecuniary distresses, and
the profound study and severe labour entailed by the preparation
for and the composition of <i>The Advancement of Learning</i>
(1603&ndash;5).&nbsp; He must be a stout-hearted Baconian who can
believe that, between 1599 and 1605, Bacon was writing
<i>Hamlet</i>, and other masterpieces of tragedy or comedy.&nbsp;
But all is possible to genius.&nbsp; What Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s
Great Unknown was doing at this period, &ldquo;neither does he
know, nor do I know, but he only.&rdquo;&nbsp; He, no doubt, had
abundance of leisure.</p>
<p>At last Shakspere died (1616), and had not the mead of one
melodious tear, as far as we know, from the London wits, in the
shape of obituary verses.&nbsp; This fills Mr. Greenwood with
amazement.&nbsp; &ldquo;Was it because &lsquo;the friends of the
Muses&rsquo; were for the most part aware that Shakespeare had
not died with Shakspere?&rdquo;&nbsp; Did Jonson perchance think
that his idea might be realised when he wrote,</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What a sight it were,<br
/>
To see thee in our waters yet appear&rdquo;?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and so on.&nbsp; Did Jonson expect and hope to see <a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>the genuine
&ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo; return to the stage, seven years after
the death of Shakspere the actor, the Swan of Avon?&nbsp; As
Jonson was fairly sane, we can no more suspect him of having
hoped for this miracle than believe that most of the poets knew
the actor not to be the author.&nbsp; Moreover Jonson, while
desiring that Shakespeare might &ldquo;shine forth&rdquo; again
and cheer the drooping stage, added,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Which since thy flight from hence hath
mourned like Night,<br />
And despairs day, but for thy volume&rsquo;s light,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>that is&mdash;the Folio of 1623.&nbsp; Ben did not weave the
amazing tissue of involved and contradictory falsities attributed
to him by Baconians.&nbsp; Beaumont died in the same year as
Shakspere, who died in the depths of the country, weary of
London.&nbsp; Has Mr. Greenwood found obituary poems dropped on
the grave of the famous Beaumont?&nbsp; Did Fletcher, did Jonson,
produce one melodious tear for the loss of their friend; in
Fletcher&rsquo;s case his constant partner?&nbsp; No?&nbsp; Were
the poets, then, aware that Beaumont was a humbug, whose poems
and plays were written by Bacon? <a name="citation174a"></a><a
href="#footnote174a" class="citation">[174a]</a></p>
<p>I am not to discuss Shakespeare&rsquo;s Will, the
&ldquo;second-best bed,&rdquo; and so forth.&nbsp; But as
Shakespeare&rsquo;s Will says not a word about his books, it is
decided by Mr. Greenwood that he had no books.&nbsp; Mr.
Greenwood is a lawyer; so was my late friend Mr. Charles Elton,
Q.C., of White Staunton, <a name="page175"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 175</span>who remarks that Shakespeare
bequeathed &ldquo;all the rest of my goods, chattels, leases,
&amp;c., to my son-in-law, John Hall, gent.&rdquo;&nbsp; (He
really <i>was</i> a &ldquo;gent.&rdquo; with authentic
coat-armour.)</p>
<p>It is with Mr. Elton&rsquo;s opinion, not with my ignorance,
that Mr. Greenwood must argue in proof of the view that
&ldquo;goods&rdquo; are necessarily exclusive of books, for Mr.
Elton takes it as a quite natural fact that Shakespeare&rsquo;s
books passed, with his other goods, to Mr. Hall, and thence to a
Mr. Nash, to whom Mr. Hall left &ldquo;my study of books&rdquo;
<a name="citation175a"></a><a href="#footnote175a"
class="citation">[175a]</a> (library).&nbsp; I only give this as
a lawyer&rsquo;s opinion.</p>
<p>There is in the Bodleian an Aldine Ovid, &ldquo;with
Shakespeare&rsquo;s&rdquo; signature (merely Wm. She.), and a
note, &ldquo;This little volume of Ovid was given to me by W.
Hall, who sayd it was once Will Shakespeare&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp;
I do not know that the signature (like that on Florio&rsquo;s
<i>Montaigne</i>, in the British Museum) has been detected as a
forgery; nor do I know that Shakespeare&rsquo;s not specially
mentioning his books proves that he had none.&nbsp; Lawyers
appear to differ as to this inference: both Mr. Elton and Mr.
Greenwood seem equally confident. <a name="citation175b"></a><a
href="#footnote175b" class="citation">[175b]</a>&nbsp; But if <a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>it were
perfectly natural that the actor, Shakspere, should have no
books, then he certainly made no effort, by the local colour of
owning a few volumes, to persuade mankind that he <i>was</i> the
author.&nbsp; Yet they believed that he was&mdash;really there is
no wriggling out of it.&nbsp; As regards any of his own MSS.
which Shakespeare may have had (one would expect them to be at
his theatre), and their monetary value, if they were not, as
usual, the property of his company, and of him as a member
thereof, we can discuss that question in the section headed
&ldquo;The First Folio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It appears that Shakespeare&rsquo;s daughter, Judith, could
write no more than her grandfather. <a name="citation176a"></a><a
href="#footnote176a" class="citation">[176a]</a>&nbsp; Nor, I
repeat, could the Lady Jane Gordon, daughter of the great Earl of
Huntly, when she was married to the Earl of Bothwell in
1566.&nbsp; At all events, Lady Jane &ldquo;made her
mark.&rdquo;&nbsp; It may be feared that Judith, brought up in
that very illiterate town of Stratford, under an illiterate
mother, was neglected in her education.&nbsp; Sad, but very
common in women of her rank, and scarcely a proof that her father
did not write the plays.</p>
<p>As &ldquo;nothing is known of the disposition and
character&rdquo; <a name="citation176b"></a><a
href="#footnote176b" class="citation">[176b]</a> of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s grand-daughter, Lady Barnard, who died in
1670, it is not so paralysingly strange that nothing is known of
any relics or anecdotes of Shakespeare which she may have
possessed.&nbsp; Mr. Greenwood &ldquo;would <a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>have
supposed that she would have had much to say about the great
poet,&rdquo; exhibited his books (if any), and so forth.&nbsp;
Perhaps she did,&mdash;but how, if we &ldquo;know nothing about
her disposition and character,&rdquo; can we tell?&nbsp; No
interviewers rushed to her house (Abington Hall,
Northampton-shire) with pencils and notebooks to record her
utterances; no reporter interviewed her for the press.&nbsp; It
is surprising, is it not?</p>
<p>The inference might be drawn, in the Baconian manner, that,
during the Commonwealth and Restoration, &ldquo;the friends of
the Muses&rdquo; knew that the actor was <i>not</i> the author,
and therefore did not interview his granddaughter in the
country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, at any rate, we have the Stratford
monument,&rdquo; says Mr. Greenwood, and delves into this
problem.&nbsp; Even the Stratford monument of Shakespeare in the
parish church is haunted by Baconian mysteries.&nbsp; If the
gentle reader will throw his eye over the photograph <a
name="citation177a"></a><a href="#footnote177a"
class="citation">[177a]</a> of the monument as it now exists, he
may not be able to say to the face of the poet&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thou wast that all to me, Will,<br />
For which my soul did pine.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But if he has any knowledge of Jacobean busts on monuments, he
will probably agree with me in saying, &ldquo;This effigy, though
executed by somebody who was not a Pheidias, and who perhaps
worked merely from descriptions, is, at <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>all events,
Jacobean.&rdquo;&nbsp; The same may assuredly be said of the
monument; it is in good Jacobean style: the pillars with their
capitals are graceful: all the rest is in keeping; and the two
inscriptions are in the square capital letters of inscriptions of
the period; not in italic characters.&nbsp; Distrusting my own
<i>expertise</i>, I have consulted Sir Sidney Colvin, and Mr.
Holmes of the National Portrait Gallery.&nbsp; They, with Mr.
Spielmann, think the work to be of the early seventeenth
century.</p>
<p>Next, glance at the figure opposite.&nbsp; This is a
reproduction of &ldquo;the earliest representation of the
Bust&rdquo; (and monument) in Dugdale&rsquo;s <i>Antiquities of
Warwickshire</i> (1656).&nbsp; Compare the two objects, point by
point, from the potato on top with holes in it, of Dugdale, which
is meant for a skull, through all the details,&mdash;bust and
all.&nbsp; Does Dugdale&rsquo;s print, whether engraved by Hollar
or not, represent a Jacobean work?&nbsp; Look at the two
ludicrous children, their legs dangling in air; at the
lions&rsquo; heads above the capitals of the pillars; at the
lettering of the two visible words of the inscription, and at the
gloomy hypochondriac or lunatic, clasping a cushion to his
abdomen.&nbsp; That hideous design was not executed by an artist
who &ldquo;had his eye on the object,&rdquo; if the object were a
Jacobean monument: while the actual monument was fashioned in no
period of art but the Jacobean.&nbsp; From Digges&rsquo; rhymes
in the Folio of 1623, we know that Shakespeare already had <a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>his
&ldquo;Stratford monument.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>The existing object is
what he had</i>; the monument in Dugdale is what, I hope, no
architect of 1616&ndash;23 could have imagined or designed.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Dugdale&rsquo;s engraving is not a correct copy of any genuine
Jacobean work of art.&nbsp; Is Dugdale accurate in his
reproductions of other monuments in Stratford Church?&nbsp; To
satisfy himself on this point, Sir George Trevelyan, as he wrote
to me (June 13, 1912), &ldquo;made a sketch of the Carew
Renaissance monument in Stratford Church, and found that the
discrepancies between the original tomb and the representation in
Dugdale&rsquo;s <i>Warwickshire</i> are far and away greater than
in the monument to William Shakespeare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood, <a name="citation179a"></a><a
href="#footnote179a" class="citation">[179a]</a> while justly
observing that &ldquo;the little sitting figures . . . are placed
as no monumental sculptor would place them,&rdquo; &ldquo;on the
whole sees no reason at all why we should doubt the substantial
accuracy of Dugdale&rsquo;s figure . . .&nbsp; It is impossible
to suppose that Hollar would have drawn and that Dugdale would
have published a mere travesty of the Stratford
Monument.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I do not know who drew the design, but a travesty of Jacobean
work it is in every detail of the monument.&nbsp; A travesty is
what Dugdale gives as a representation of the Carew
monument.&nbsp; Mr. Greenwood, elsewhere, repeating his criticism
of the impossible figures of children, says: &ldquo;This <a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>is
certainly mere matter of detail, and, in the absence of other
evidence, would give us no warrant for doubting the substantial
accuracy of Dugdale&rsquo;s presentment of the
&lsquo;Shakespeare&rsquo; bust.&rdquo; <a
name="citation180a"></a><a href="#footnote180a"
class="citation">[180a]</a></p>
<p>Why are we to believe that Dugdale&rsquo;s artist was merely
fantastic in his design of the children (and also remote from
Jacobean taste in every detail), and yet to credit him with
&ldquo;substantial accuracy&rdquo; in his half-length of a gloomy
creature clutching a cushion to his stomach?&nbsp; With his
inaccuracies as to the Carew monument, why are we to accept him
as accurate in his representation of the bust?&nbsp; Moreover,
other evidence is not wanting.&nbsp; It is positively certain
that the monument existing in 1748, was then known as &ldquo;the
original monument,&rdquo; and that no other monument was put in
its place, at that date or later.</p>

<p>Now Mrs. Stopes <a name="citation180b"></a><a
href="#footnote180b" class="citation">[180b]</a> argues that in
1748 the monument was &ldquo;entirely reconstructed,&rdquo; and
so must have become no longer what Dugdale&rsquo;s man drew, but
what we see to-day.&nbsp; It is positively certain that her
opinion is erroneous.</p>
<p>If ever what we see to-day was substituted for anything like
what Dugdale&rsquo;s man drew, the date of the substitution is
unknown.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stopes herself discovered the documents which disprove
her theory.&nbsp; They were known to Halliwell-Phillipps, who
quotes an unnamed &ldquo;contemporary account.&rdquo; <a
name="citation181a"></a><a href="#footnote181a"
class="citation">[181a]</a>&nbsp; <a name="page181"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 181</span>This account Mrs. Stopes, with her
tireless industry, found in the Wheler manuscripts, among papers
of the Rev. Joseph Greene, in 1746 Head Master of the Grammar
School.&nbsp; In one paper of September 1740 &ldquo;the original
monument&rdquo; is said to be &ldquo;much impaired and
decayed.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was a scheme for making &ldquo;a new
monument&rdquo; in Westminster Abbey.&nbsp; <i>That</i>, I
venture to think, would have been in Hanoverian, not in Jacobean
taste and style.&nbsp; But there was no money for a new
monument.&nbsp; Mrs. Stopes also found a paper of November 20,
1748, showing that in September 1746, Mr. Ward (grandfather of
Mrs. Siddons) was at Stratford with &ldquo;a cry of
players.&rdquo;&nbsp; He devoted the proceeds of a performance of
<i>Othello</i> to the reparation of the then existing
monument.&nbsp; The amount was twelve pounds ten shillings.&nbsp;
The affair dragged on, one of the Church-wardens, a blacksmith,
held the &pound;12, 10<i>s.</i>, and was troublesome.&nbsp; The
document of November 20, 1748, was drawn up to be signed, but was
not signed, by the persons who appear to be chiefly concerned in
the matter.&nbsp; It directed that Mr. Hall, a local limner or
painter, is to &ldquo;take care, according to his ability, that
the monument shall become as like as possible to what it was when
first erected.&rdquo;&nbsp; This appears to have been the idea of
Mr. Greene.&nbsp; Another form of words was later adopted,
directing Mr. Hall, the painter, <a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>&ldquo;to repair and beautify, or to
have the direction of repairing and beautifying, <i>the original
monument</i> of Shakespeare the poet.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Stopes
infers, justly in my opinion, that Hall &ldquo;would fill up the
gaps, restore what was amissing as he thought it ought to be, and
finally repaint it according to the original colours, traces of
which he might still be able to see.&rdquo;&nbsp; In his
<i>History and Antiquities of Stratford-on-Avon</i>, <a
name="citation182a"></a><a href="#footnote182a"
class="citation">[182a]</a> Mr. Wheler tells us that this was
what Hall did.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the year 1748 the monument was
carefully repaired, and the original colours of the bust,
&amp;c., as much as possible preserved by Mr. John Hall, limner,
of Stratford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It follows that we see the original monument and bust, but the
painting is of 1861, for the bust, says Wheler, was in 1793
&ldquo;painted in white,&rdquo; to please Malone.&nbsp; It was
repainted in 1861.</p>
<p>Mrs. Stopes, unluckily, is not content with what Hall was told
to do, and what, according to Wheler, he did.&nbsp; She writes:
&ldquo;It would only be giving good value for his money&rdquo;
(&pound;12, 10<i>s.</i>) &ldquo;to his churchwardens if Hall
added (<i>sic</i>) a cloak, a pen, and manuscript.&rdquo;&nbsp;
He &ldquo;could not help changing&rdquo; the face, and so on.</p>
<p>Now it was physically impossible to <i>add</i> a cloak, a pen,
and manuscript to such a stone bust as Dugdale&rsquo;s man shows;
to take away the cushion pressed to the stomach, and to alter the
head.&nbsp; Mr. Hall, if he was to give us the present bust, <a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>had to make
an entirely new bust, and, to give us the present monument in
place of that shown in Dugdale&rsquo;s print, had to construct an
entirely new monument.&nbsp; Now Hall was a painter, not (like
Giulio Romano) also an architect and sculptor.&nbsp; <i>Pour tout
potage</i> he had but &pound;12, 10<i>s.</i>&nbsp; He could not
do, and he did not do these things! he did not destroy &ldquo;the
original monument&rdquo; and make a new monument in Jacobean
style.&nbsp; He was straitly ordered to &ldquo;repair and
beautify the original monument&rdquo;; he did repair it, and
repainted the colours.&nbsp; That is all.&nbsp; I do not quote
what Halliwell-Phillipps tells us <a name="citation183a"></a><a
href="#footnote183a" class="citation">[183a]</a> about the
repairing of the forefinger and thumb of the right hand, and the
pen; work which, he says, had to be renewed by William Roberts of
Oxford in 1790.&nbsp; He gives no authority, and Baconians may
say that he was hoaxed, or &ldquo;lied with
circumstance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood <a name="citation183b"></a><a
href="#footnote183b" class="citation">[183b]</a> quotes
Halliwell-Phillipps&rsquo;s <i>Works of Shakespeare</i> (1853),
in which he says that the design in Dugdale&rsquo;s book
&ldquo;is evidently too inaccurate to be of any authority; the
probability being that it was not taken from the monument
itself.&rdquo;&nbsp; Indeed the designer is so inaccurate that he
gives the first word of the Latin inscription as
&ldquo;Judicyo,&rdquo; just as Oudry blunders in the Latin
inscription of a portrait of Mary Stuart which he copied
badly.&nbsp; Mr. Greenwood <a name="page184"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>proceeds: &ldquo;In his
<i>Outlines</i> Halliwell simply ignores Dugdale.&nbsp; His
engraving was doubtless too inconvenient to be brought to public
notice!&rdquo;&nbsp; Here Halliwell is accused of suppressing the
truth; if he invented his minute details about the repeated
reparation of the writing hand,&mdash;not represented in
Dugdale&rsquo;s design,&mdash;he also lied with
circumstance.&nbsp; But he certainly quoted a genuine
&ldquo;contemporary account&rdquo; of the orders for repairing
and beautifying the original monument in 1748, and I presume that
he also had records for what he says about reparations of the
hand and pen.&nbsp; He speaks, too, of substitutions for decayed
alabaster parts of the monument, though not in his
<i>Outlines</i>; and I observe that, in Mrs. Stopes&rsquo;s
papers, there is record of a meeting on December 20, 1748, at
which mention was made of &ldquo;the materials&rdquo; which Hall
was to use for repairs.</p>
<p>To me the evidence of the style as to the date of both
monument and bust speaks so loudly for their accepted date
(1616&ndash;23) and against the Georgian date of 1748, that I
need no other evidence; nor do I suppose that any one familiar
with the monumental style of 1590&ndash;1620 can be of a
different opinion.&nbsp; In the same way I do not expect any
artist or engraver to take the engraving of the monument in
Rowe&rsquo;s <i>Shakespeare</i> (1709), and that by Grignion so
late as 1786, for anything but copies of the design in Dugdale,
with modifications made <i>&agrave; plaisir</i>.&nbsp; In <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>Pope&rsquo;s edition (1725) Vertue gives the monument
with some approach to accuracy, but for the bald plump face of
the bust presents a top-heavy and sculpturally impossible face
borrowed from &ldquo;the Chandos portrait,&rdquo; which, in my
opinion, is of no more authority than any other portrait of
Shakespeare.&nbsp; None of them, I conceive, was painted from the
life.</p>
<p>The Baconians show a wistful longing to suppose the original
bust, copied in Dugdale, to have been meant for Bacon; but we
need not waste words over this speculation.&nbsp; Mr. Greenwood
writes that &ldquo;if I should be told that Dugdale&rsquo;s
effigy represented an elderly farmer deploring an exceptionally
bad harvest, &lsquo;I should not feel it to be
strange!&rsquo;&nbsp; Neither should I feel it at all strange if
I were told that it was the presentment of a philosopher and Lord
Chancellor, who had fallen from high estate and recognised that
all things are but vanity.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> should not feel it to be strange&rdquo; if a
Baconian told me that the effigy of a living ex-Chancellor were
placed in the monument of the dead Will Shakspere, and if, on
asking why the alteration was made, I were asked in reply, in Mr.
Greenwood&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;Was Dugdale&rsquo;s bust thought
to bear too much resemblance to one who was not Shakspere of
Stratford?&nbsp; Or was it thought that the presence of a
woolsack&rdquo; (the cushion) &ldquo;might be taken as indicating
that Shakspere of Stratford was indebted for support <a

certain Lord Chancellor?&rdquo; <a name="citation186a"></a><a
href="#footnote186a" class="citation">[186a]</a>&nbsp; Such,
indeed, are the things that Baconians might readily say: do say,
I believe.</p>
<p>Dugdale&rsquo;s engraving reproduces the first words of a
Latin inscription, still on the monument:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>Judicio Pylium</i>, <i>genio Socratem</i>,
<i>arte Maronem</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Terra tegit</i>, <i>populus m&aelig;ret</i>,
<i>Olympus habet</i>:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Earth covers, Olympus&rdquo; (heaven? or the
Muses&rsquo; Hill?) &ldquo;holds him who was a Nestor in counsel;
in poetic art, a Virgil; a Socrates for his D&aelig;mon&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Genius&rdquo;).&nbsp; As for the &ldquo;Genius,&rdquo; or
d&aelig;mon of Socrates, and the permitted false quantity in
making the first syllable of Socrates short; and the use of
<i>Olympus</i> for heaven in epitaphs, it is sufficient to
consult the learning of Mr. Elton. <a name="citation186b"></a><a
href="#footnote186b" class="citation">[186b]</a>&nbsp; The poet
who made such notable false quantities in his plays had no cause
to object to another on his monument.&nbsp; We do not know who
erected the monument, and paid for it, or who wrote or adapted
the epitaph; but it was somebody who thought Shakespeare (or
Bacon?) &ldquo;a clayver man.&rdquo;&nbsp; The monument (if a
trembling conjecture may be humbly put forth) was conceivably
erected by the piety of Shakespeare&rsquo;s daughter and
son-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Hall.&nbsp; They exhibit a taste for the
mortuary memorial and the queer Latin inscription.&nbsp; Mrs.
Hall gratified <a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>the Manes of her poor mother, Mrs. Shakespeare, with
one of the oddest of Latin epitaphs. <a
name="citation187a"></a><a href="#footnote187a"
class="citation">[187a]</a>&nbsp; It opens like an epigram in the
Greek Anthology, and ends in an unusual strain of Christian
mysticism.&nbsp; Mr. Hall possesses, perhaps arranged for
himself, a few Latin elegiacs as an epitaph.</p>
<p>The famous &ldquo;Good friend for Jesus&rsquo; sake
forbear,&rdquo; and so on, on the stone in the chancel, beneath
which the sacred dust of Shakespeare lies, or lay, is the first
of &ldquo;the last lines written, we are told,&rdquo; <a
name="citation187b"></a><a href="#footnote187b"
class="citation">[187b]</a> &ldquo;by the author of
<i>Hamlet</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Who tells us that Shakespeare wrote
the four lines of doggerel?&nbsp; Is it conceivable that the
authority for Shakespeare&rsquo;s authorship of the doggerel is a
tradition gleaned by Mr. Dowdall of Queen&rsquo;s in 1693, from a
parish clerk, aged over eighty, he says,&mdash;criticism makes
the clerk twenty years younger. <a name="citation187c"></a><a
href="#footnote187c" class="citation">[187c]</a>&nbsp; For
Baconians the lines are bad enough to be the work of William
Shakspere of Stratford.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in 1649, when Will&rsquo;s daughter, Mrs. Hall,
died, her epitaph spoke quite respectfully of her father&rsquo;s
intelligence.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Witty above her sex, but that&rsquo;s not
all,<br />
Wise to salvation was good Mistris Hall,<br />
Something of Shakespeare was in <i>that</i>, but <i>this</i><br
/>
Wholly of Him with whom she&rsquo;s now in bliss.&rdquo; <a
name="citation187d"></a><a href="#footnote187d"
class="citation">[187d]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>Thirty-three years after Shakespeare&rsquo;s death he
was still thought &ldquo;witty&rdquo; in Stratford.&nbsp; But
what could Stratford know?&nbsp; Milton and Charles I were of the
same opinion; so was Suckling, and the rest of the generation
after Shakespeare.&nbsp; But they did not know, how should they,
that Bacon (or his equivalent) was the genuine author of the
plays and poems.&nbsp; The secret, perhaps, so widely spread
among &ldquo;the friends of the Muses&rdquo; in 1616, was
singularly well kept by a set of men rather given to blab as a
general rule.</p>
<p>I confess to be passing weary of the Baconian hatred of Will,
which pursues him beyond his death with sneers and fantastic
suspicions about his monument and his grave, and asks if he
&ldquo;died with a curse upon his lips, an imprecation against
any man who might <i>move his bones</i>?&nbsp; A mean and vulgar
curse indeed!&rdquo; <a name="citation188a"></a><a
href="#footnote188a" class="citation">[188a]</a>&nbsp; And the
authority for the circumstance that he died with a mean and
vulgar curse upon his lips?</p>
<p>About 1694, a year after Mr. Dowdall in 1693, and eighty years
almost after Shakespeare&rsquo;s death, W. Hall, a Queen&rsquo;s
man, Oxford (the W. Hall, perhaps, who gave the Bodleian Aldine
Ovid, with Shakespeare&rsquo;s signature, true or forged, to its
unknown owner), went to Stratford, and wrote about his pilgrimage
to his friend Mr. Thwaites, a Fellow of Queen&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Mr.
Hall heard the story that Shakespeare was the author of the mean
and vulgar curse.&nbsp; He adds that there was a <a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>great
ossuary or bone-house in the church, where all the bones dug up
were piled, &ldquo;they would load a great number of
waggons.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not desiring this promiscuity, Shakespeare
wrote the Curse in a style intelligible to clerks and sextons,
&ldquo;for the most part a very ignorant sort of
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Shakespeare <i>did</i>, that accommodation of himself to
his audience was the last stroke of his wisdom, or his wit. <a
name="citation189a"></a><a href="#footnote189a"
class="citation">[189a]</a>&nbsp; Of course there is no evidence
that he wrote the mean and vulgar curse: that he did is only the
pious hope of the Baconians and Anti-Willians.</p>
<p>Into the question of the alleged portraits of Shakespeare I
cannot enter.&nbsp; Ben spoke well of the engraving prefixed to
the First Folio, but Ben, as Mr. Greenwood says, was anxious to
give the Folio &ldquo;a good send-off.&rdquo;&nbsp; The engraving
is choicely bad; we do not know from what actual portrait, if
from any, it was executed.&nbsp; Richard Burbage is known to have
amused himself with the art of design; possibly he tried his hand
on a likeness of his old friend and fellow-actor.&nbsp; If so, he
may have succeeded no better than Mary Stuart&rsquo;s
embroiderer, Oudry, in his copy of the portrait of her
Majesty.</p>
<p>That Ben Jonson was painted by Honthorst and others, while
Shakespeare, as far as we know, was not, has nothing to do with
the authorship <a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>of the plays.&nbsp; Ben was a scholar, the darling of
both Universities; constantly employed about the Court in
arranging Masques; his learning and his Scottish blood may have
led James I to notice him.&nbsp; Ben, in his later years, was
much in society; fashionable and literary.&nbsp; He was the
father of the literary &ldquo;tribe of Ben.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus he
naturally sat for his portrait.&nbsp; In the same way George
Buchanan has, and had, nothing like the fame of Knox.&nbsp; But
as a scholar he was of European reputation; haunted the Court as
tutor of his King, and was the &ldquo;good pen&rdquo; of the
anti-Marian nobles, Murray, Morton, and the rest.&nbsp; Therefore
Buchanan&rsquo;s portrait was painted, while of Knox we have only
a woodcut, done, apparently, after his death, from descriptions,
for Beza&rsquo;s <i>Icones</i>.&nbsp; The Folio engraving may
have no better source.&nbsp; Without much minute research it is
hard to find authentic portraits of Mary Stuart, and, just as in
Shakespeare&rsquo;s case, <a name="citation190a"></a><a
href="#footnote190a" class="citation">[190a]</a> the market, in
her own day and in the eighteenth century, was flooded with
&ldquo;mock-originals,&rdquo; not even derived (in any case known
to me) from genuine and authentic contemporary works.</p>
<p>One thing is certain about the Stratford bust.&nbsp; Baconians
will believe that Dugdale&rsquo;s man correctly represented the
bust as it was in his time; and that the actual bust is of 1748,
in spite of proofs of Dugdale&rsquo;s man&rsquo;s fantastic
inaccuracy; in spite of the evidence of style; and in spite of <a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>documentary
evidence that &ldquo;the original monument&rdquo; was not to be
destroyed and replaced by the actual monument, but was merely
&ldquo;repaired and beautified&rdquo; (painted afresh) by a local
painter.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">&ldquo;THE TRADITIONAL
SHAKSPERE&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> perusing the copious arguments
of the Anti-Shakesperean but Non-Baconian Mr. Greenwood, I am
often tempted, in Socratic phrase, to address him thus: Best of
men, let me implore you, first, to keep in memory these
statements on which you have most eloquently and abundantly
insisted, namely, that society in Stratford was not only not
literary, but was illiterate.&nbsp; Next pardon me for asking you
to remember that the late sixteenth and the early seventeenth
century did not resemble our fortunate age.&nbsp; Some people
read Shakespeare&rsquo;s, Beaumont&rsquo;s, and Fletcher&rsquo;s
plays.&nbsp; This exercise is now very rarely practised.&nbsp;
But nobody cared to chronicle literary gossip about the private
lives and personal traits of these and several other Elizabethan
and Jacobean playwrights, in the modern manner.&nbsp; Of
Shakespeare (pardon, I mean Shakspere), the actor, there is one
contemporary anecdote, in my poor opinion a baseless
waggery.&nbsp; Of Beaumont there is none.&nbsp; Of a hand-maid of
Fletcher, who drank sack in a tumbler, one anecdote appears at
the end of the seventeenth century,&mdash;nothing better.&nbsp;
Meanwhile of Shakspere the &ldquo;traditions&rdquo; must be
sought <a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>either at Stratford or in connection with the London
Stage; and in both cases the traditions began to be in demand
very late.</p>
<p>As Stratford was not literary, indeed was terribly illiterate,
any traditions that survived cannot conceivably have been
literary.&nbsp; That is absolutely certain.&nbsp; Natives at
Stratford had, by your own hypothesis, scant interest in literary
anecdote.&nbsp; Fifty years after Shakespeare&rsquo;s death, no
native was likely to cherish tales of any sprouts of wit (though
it was remembered in 1649, that he was &ldquo;witty&rdquo;), or
any &ldquo;wood-notes wild,&rdquo; which he may have displayed or
chirped at an early age.</p>
<p>Such things were of no interest to Stratford.&nbsp; If he made
a speech when he killed a calf, or poached, or ran away to town,
the circumstance might descend from one gaffer to another; he
might even be remembered as &ldquo;the best of his
family,&rdquo;&mdash;the least inefficient.&nbsp; Given your
non-literary and illiterate Stratford, and you can expect nothing
more, and nothing better, than we receive.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate by a modern example.&nbsp; In 1866 I was an
undergraduate of a year&rsquo;s standing at Balliol College,
Oxford, certainly not an unlettered academy.&nbsp; In that year,
the early and the best poems of a considerable Balliol poet were
published: he had &ldquo;gone down&rdquo; some eight years
before.&nbsp; Being young and green I eagerly sought for
traditions about Mr. Swinburne.&nbsp; One <a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>of his
contemporaries, who took a First in the final Classical Schools,
told me that &ldquo;he was a smug.&rdquo;&nbsp; Another, that, as
Mr. Swinburne and his friend (later a Scotch professor) were not
cricketers, they proposed that they should combine to pay but a
single subscription to the Cricket Club.&nbsp; A third, a tutor
of the highest reputation as a moralist and metaphysician, merely
smiled at my early enthusiasm,&mdash;and told me nothing.&nbsp; A
white-haired College servant said that &ldquo;Mr. Swinburne was a
very quiet gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then you take us to dirty illiterate Stratford, from fifty to
eighty years after Shakspere&rsquo;s death,&mdash;a Civil War and
the Reign of the Saints, a Restoration and a Revolution having
intervened,&mdash;and ask us to be surprised that no anecdotes of
Shakspere&rsquo;s early brilliance, a century before, survived at
Stratford.</p>
<p>A very humble parallel may follow.&nbsp; Some foolish person
went seeking early anecdotes of myself at my native town, Selkirk
on the Ettrick.&nbsp; From an intelligent townsman he gathered
much that was true and interesting about my younger brothers, who
delighted in horses and dogs, hunted, shot, and fished, and
played cricket; one of them bowled for Gloucestershire and
Oxford.&nbsp; But about me the inquiring literary snipe only
heard that &ldquo;Andra was aye the stupid ane o&rsquo; the
fam&rsquo;ly.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet, I, too, had bowled for the local
club, <i>non sine gloria</i>!&nbsp; Even <i>that</i> was
forgotten.</p>
<p>Try to remember, best of men, that literary <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>anecdotes
of a fellow townsman&rsquo;s youth do not dwell in the memories
of his neighbours from sixty to a hundred years after date.&nbsp;
It is not in human nature that what was incomprehensible to the
grandsire should be remembered by the grandson.&nbsp; Go to
&ldquo;Thrums&rdquo; and ask for literary memories of the youth
of Mr. Barrie.</p>
<p>Yet <a name="citation198a"></a><a href="#footnote198a"
class="citation">[198a]</a> the learned Malone seems to have been
sorry that little of Shakespeare but the calf-killing and the
poaching, and the dying of a fever after drink taken
(<i>where</i>, I ask you?), with Ben and Drayton, was remembered,
so long after date, at Stratford, of all dirty ignorant
places.&nbsp; Bah! how could these people have heard of Drayton
and Ben?&nbsp; Remember that we are dealing with human nature, in
a peculiarly malodorous and densely ignorant <i>bourgade</i>,
where, however, the &ldquo;wit&rdquo; of Shakespeare was not
forgotten (in the family) in 1649.&nbsp; See the epithet on the
tomb of his daughter, Mrs. Hall.</p>
<p>You give us the Rev. John Ward, vicar of Stratford
(1661&ndash;3), who has heard that the actor was &ldquo;a natural
wit,&rdquo; and contracted and died of a fever, after a bout with
Drayton and Ben.&nbsp; I can scarcely believe that <i>these</i>
were local traditions.&nbsp; How could these <i>rustauds</i> have
an opinion about &ldquo;natural wit,&rdquo; how could they have
known the names of Ben and Drayton?</p>
<p>When you come to Aubrey, publishing in 1680, sixty years after
Shakespeare&rsquo;s death, you neglect <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>to trace
the steps in the descent of his tradition.&nbsp; As has been
stated, Beeston, &ldquo;the chronicle of the Stage&rdquo; (died
1682), gave him the story of the school-mastering; Beeston being
the son of a servitor of Phillips, an actor and friend of
Shakespeare, who died eleven years before that player.&nbsp; The
story of the school-mastering and of Shakespeare &ldquo;knowing
Latin pretty well,&rdquo; is of no value to me.&nbsp; I think
that he had some knowledge of Latin, as he must have had, if he
were what I fancy him to have been, and if (which is mere
hypothesis) he went for four years to a Latin School.&nbsp; But
the story does not suit you, and you call it &ldquo;a mere
myth,&rdquo; which, &ldquo;of course, will be believed by those
who wish to believe it.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, most excellent of
mortals, will it not, by parity of reasoning, &ldquo;of course be
disbelieved by those who do <i>not</i> wish to believe
it&rdquo;?</p>
<p>And do you want to believe it?</p>
<p>To several stage anecdotes of the actor as an excellent
instructor of younger players, you refer slightingly.&nbsp; They
do not weigh with me: still, the Stage would remember Shakspere
(or Shakespeare) best in stage affairs.&nbsp; In reference to a
very elliptic statement that, &ldquo;in <i>Hamlet</i> Betterton
benefited by Shakespeare&rsquo;s coaching,&rdquo; you write,
&ldquo;This is astonishing, seeing that Shakspere had been in his
grave nearly twenty years when Betterton was born.&nbsp; The
explanation is that Taylor, of the Black Fryars Company, was,
according to Sir William Davenant, <a name="page200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>instructed by Shakspere, and
Davenant, who had seen Taylor act, according to Downes,
instructed Betterton.&nbsp; There is a similar story about
Betterton playing King Henry VIII.&nbsp; Betterton was said to
have been instructed by Sir William, who was instructed by Lowen,
who was instructed by Shakspere!&rdquo; <a
name="citation200a"></a><a href="#footnote200a"
class="citation">[200a]</a></p>
<p>Why a note of exclamation?&nbsp; Who was Downes, and what were
his opportunities of acquiring information?&nbsp; He &ldquo;was
for many years book-keeper in the Duke&rsquo;s Company, first
under Davenant in the old house . . . &rdquo;&nbsp; Davenant was
notoriously the main link between &ldquo;the first and second
Temple,&rdquo; the theatre of Shakespeare whom, as a boy, he
knew, and the Restoration theatre.&nbsp; Devoted to the
traditions of the stage, he collected Shakespearean and other
anecdotes; he revived the theatre, cautiously, during the last
years of Puritan rule, and told his stories to the players of the
early Restoration.&nbsp; As his Book-keeper with the Duke of
York&rsquo;s Company, Downes heard what Davenant had to tell; he
also, for his <i>Roscius Anglicanus</i>, had notes from Charles
Booth, prompter at Drury Lane.&nbsp; On May 28, 1663, Davenant
reproduced <i>Hamlet</i>, with young Betterton as the Prince of
Denmark.&nbsp; Davenant, says Charles Booth, &ldquo;had seen the
part taken by Taylor, of the Black Fryars Company, and Taylor had
been instructed by the author,&rdquo; (not Bacon but) &ldquo;Mr.
William Shakespeare,&rdquo; <a name="page201"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 201</span>and Davenant &ldquo;taught Mr.
Betterton in every particle of it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Elton adds,
&ldquo;We cannot be sure that Taylor was taught by Shakespeare
himself.&nbsp; He is believed to have been a member of the
King&rsquo;s Company before 1613, and to have left it for a time
before Shakespeare&rsquo;s death.&rdquo; <a
name="citation201a"></a><a href="#footnote201a"
class="citation">[201a]</a>&nbsp; His name is in the list in the
Folio of &ldquo;the principall Actors in all these plays,&rdquo;
but I cannot pretend to be certain that he played in them in
Will&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>It is Mr. Pepys (December 30, 1668) who chronicles
Davenant&rsquo;s splendid revival of <i>Henry VIII</i>, in which
Betterton, as the King, was instructed by Sir William Davenant,
who had it from old Mr. Lowen, that had his instruction
&ldquo;from Mr. Shakespear himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lowin, or Lowen,
joined Shakespeare&rsquo;s Company in 1604, being then a man of
twenty-eight.&nbsp; Burbage was the natural man for Hamlet and
Henry VIII; but it is not unusual for actors to have
&ldquo;understudies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stage is notoriously tenacious of such traditions.</p>
<p>When we come with you to Mr. W. Fulman, about 1688, and the
additions to his notes made about 1690&ndash;1708, we are
concerned with evidence much too remote, and, in your own
classical style, &ldquo;all this is just a little mixed.&rdquo;
<a name="citation201b"></a><a href="#footnote201b"
class="citation">[201b]</a>&nbsp; <a name="page202"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 202</span>With what Mr. Dowdall heard in 1693,
and Mr. William Hall (1694) heard from a clerk or sexton, or
other illiterate dotard at Stratford, I have already dealt.&nbsp;
I do not habitually believe in what I hear from &ldquo;the oldest
aunt telling the saddest tale,&rdquo;&mdash;no, not even if she
tells a ghost story, or an anecdote about the presentation by
Queen Mary of her portrait to the ancestor of the
Laird,&mdash;the portrait being dated 1768, and representing her
Majesty in the bloom of girlhood.&nbsp; Nor do I care for what
Rowe said (on Betterton&rsquo;s information), in 1709, about
Shakespeare&rsquo;s schooling; nor for what Dr. Furnivall said
that Plume wrote; nor for what anybody said that Sir John Mennes
(Menzies?) said.&nbsp; But I do care for what Ben Jonson and
Shakespeare&rsquo;s fellow-actors said; and for what his literary
contemporaries have left on record.&nbsp; But this evidence you
explain away by &aelig;tiological guesses, absolutely modern,
and, I conceive, to anyone familiar with historical inquiry, not
more valuable as history than other explanatory myths.</p>
<p>What Will Shakspere had to his literary credit when he died,
was men&rsquo;s impressions of the seeing of his acted plays;
with their knowledge, if they had any, of fugitive, cheap,
perishable, and often bad reprints, in quartos, of about half of
the plays.&nbsp; Men also had <i>Venus and Adonis</i>,
<i>Lucrece</i>, and the Sonnets, which sold very poorly, and I do
not wonder at it.&nbsp; Of the genius of Shakespeare England
could form no conception, till the <a name="page203"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 203</span>publication of the Folio (1623), not
in a large edition; it struggled into a Third Edition in
1664.&nbsp; The <i>engouement</i> about the poet, the search for
personal details, did not manifest itself with any vigour till
nearly thirty years after 1664&mdash;and we are to wonder that
the gleanings, at illiterate Stratford, and in Stage tradition,
are so scanty and so valueless.&nbsp; What could have been picked
up, by 1680&ndash;90, about Bacon at Gorhambury, or in the Courts
of Law, I wonder.</p>
<h2><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>XI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE FIRST FOLIO</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The</span> First Folio&rdquo; is
the name commonly given to the first collected edition of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays.&nbsp; The volume includes a Preface
signed by two of the actors, Heminge and Condell, panegyrical
verses by Ben Jonson and others, and a bad engraved
portrait.&nbsp; The book has been microscopically examined by
Baconians, hunting for cyphered messages from their idol in
italics, capital letters, misprints, and everywhere.&nbsp; Their
various discoveries do not win the assent of writers like the
late Lord Penzance and Mr. Greenwood.</p>
<p>The mystery as to the sources, editing, and selection of plays
in the Folio (1623) appears to be impenetrable.&nbsp; The
title-page says that <i>all</i> the contents are published
&ldquo;according to the true original copies.&rdquo;&nbsp; If
<i>only</i> MS. copies are meant, this is untrue; in some cases
the best quartos were the chief source, supplemented by
MSS.&nbsp; The Baconians, following Malone, think that Ben Jonson
wrote the Preface (and certainly it looks like his work), <a
name="citation207a"></a><a href="#footnote207a"
class="citation">[207a]</a> speaking in the name of the two
actors who sign it.&nbsp; They say that Shakespeare&rsquo;s <a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>friends
&ldquo;have collected and published&rdquo; the plays, have so
published them &ldquo;that whereas you were abus&rsquo;d with
divers stolne and surreptitious copies, maimed and deformed by
the frauds and stealthes of injurious impostors that exposed
them: <i>even those</i>&rdquo; (namely, the pieces previously
ill-produced by pirates) &ldquo;are now offered to your view
cur&rsquo;d, and perfect of their limbes; and <i>all the
rest</i>&rdquo; (that is, all the plays which had not been
piratically debased), &ldquo;absolute in their numbers, as he
conceived them.&rdquo;&nbsp; So obscure is the Preface that not
<i>all</i> previously published separate plays are explicitly
said to be stolen and deformed, but &ldquo;<i>divers</i> stolen
copies&rdquo; are denounced.&nbsp; Mr. Pollard makes the same
point in <i>Shakespeare Folios and Quartos</i>, p. 2 (1909).</p>
<p>Now, as a matter of fact, while some of the quarto editions of
separate plays are very bad texts, others are so good that the
Folio sometimes practically reprints them, with some tinkerings,
from manuscripts.&nbsp; Some quartos, like that of <i>Hamlet</i>
of 1604, are excellent, and how they came to be printed from good
texts, and whether or not the texts were given to the press by
Shakespeare&rsquo;s Company, or were sold, or stolen, is the
question.&nbsp; Mr. Pollard argues, on grounds almost certain,
that &ldquo;we have strong <i>prima facie</i> evidence that the
sale to publishers of plays afterwards duly entered on the
Stationers&rsquo; Registers was regulated by their lawful
owners.&rdquo; <a name="citation208a"></a><a href="#footnote208a"
class="citation">[208a]</a></p>
<p><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>The
Preface does not explicitly deny that some of the separately
printed texts were good, but says that &ldquo;divers&rdquo; of
them were stolen and deformed.&nbsp; My view of the meaning of
the Preface is not generally held.&nbsp; Dr. H. H. Furness, in
his preface to <i>Much Ado about Nothing</i> (p. vi), says,
&ldquo;We all know that these two friends of Shakespeare assert
in their Preface to the Folio that they had used the
Author&rsquo;s manuscripts, and in the same breath denounce the
Quartos as stolen and surreptitious.&rdquo;&nbsp; I cannot see, I
repeat, that the Preface denounces <i>all</i> the Quartos.&nbsp;
It could be truly said that <i>divers</i> stolen and maimed
copies had been foisted on &ldquo;abused&rdquo; purchasers, and
really no more <i>is</i> said.&nbsp; Dr. Furness writes,
&ldquo;When we now find them using as &lsquo;copy&rsquo; one of
these very Quartos&rdquo; (<i>Much Ado about Nothing</i>, 1600),
&ldquo;we need not impute to them a wilful falsehood if we
suppose that in using what they knew had been printed from the
original text, howsoever obtained, they held it to be the same as
the manuscript itself . . . &rdquo;&nbsp; That <i>was</i> their
meaning, I think, the Quarto of <i>Much Ado</i> had <i>not</i>
been &ldquo;maimed&rdquo; and &ldquo;deformed,&rdquo; as divers
other quartos, stolen and surreptitious, had been.</p>
<p>Shakspere, unlike most of the other playwrights, was a member
of his Company.&nbsp; I presume that his play was thus the common
good of his Company and himself.&nbsp; If they sold a copy to the
press, the price would go into their <a name="page210"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 210</span>common stock; unless they, in good
will, allowed the author to pocket the money.</p>
<p>It will be observed that I understand the words of the Preface
otherwise than do the distinguished Editors of the Cambridge
edition.&nbsp; They write, &ldquo;The natural inference to be
drawn from this statement&rdquo; (in the Preface) &ldquo;is that
<i>all</i> the separate editions of Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays
were &lsquo;stolen,&rsquo; &lsquo;surreptitious&rsquo; and
imperfect, <i>and that all those published in the Folio were
printed from the author&rsquo;s own manuscripts</i>&rdquo; (my
italics).&nbsp; The Editors agree with Dr. Furness, not with Mr.
Pollard, whose learned opinion coincides with my own.</p>
<p>Perhaps it should be said that I reached my own construction
of the sense of this passage in the Preface by the light of
nature, before Mr. Pollard&rsquo;s valuable book, based on the
widest and most minute research, came into my hands.&nbsp; By the
results of that research he backs his opinion (and mine), that
some of the quartos are surreptitious and bad, while others are
good &ldquo;and were honestly obtained.&rdquo; <a
name="citation210a"></a><a href="#footnote210a"
class="citation">[210a]</a>&nbsp; The Preface never denies this;
never says that all the quartos contain maimed and disfigured
texts.&nbsp; The Preface draws a distinction to this effect,
&ldquo;even those&rdquo; (even the stolen and deformed copies)
&ldquo;are now cured and perfect in their
limbs,&rdquo;&mdash;that is, have been carefully edited, while
&ldquo;<i>all the rest</i>&rdquo; are &ldquo;absolute in their
numbers as he conceived them.&rdquo;&nbsp; This <a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>does not
allege that all the rest are printed from Shakespeare&rsquo;s own
holograph copies.</p>
<p>Among the plays spoken of as &ldquo;all the rest,&rdquo;
namely, those not hitherto published and not deformed by the
fraudulent, are, <i>Tempest</i>, <i>Two Gentlemen</i>, <i>Measure
for Measure</i>, <i>Comedy of Errors</i>, <i>As You Like It</i>,
<i>All&rsquo;s Well</i>, <i>Twelfth Night</i>, <i>Winter&rsquo;s
Tale</i>, <i>Henry VI</i>, iii., <i>Henry VIII</i>,
<i>Coriolanus</i>, <i>Timon</i>, <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i>,
<i>Macbeth</i>, <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, and
<i>Cymbeline</i>.&nbsp; Also <i>Henry VI</i>, i., ii., <i>King
John</i>, and <i>Taming of the Shrew</i>, appeared now in other
form than in the hitherto published Quartos bearing these or
closely similar names.&nbsp; We have, moreover, no previous
information as to <i>The Shrew</i>, <i>Timon</i>, <i>Julius
C&aelig;sar</i>, <i>All&rsquo;s Well</i>, and <i>Henry
VIII</i>.&nbsp; The Preface adds the remarkable statement that,
whatever Shakespeare thought, &ldquo;he uttered with that
easinesse, that wee have scarce received from him a blot in his
papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is plain that the many dramas previously unpublished could
only be recovered from manuscripts of one sort or another,
because they existed in no other form.&nbsp; The Preface takes it
for granted that the selected manuscripts contain the plays
&ldquo;absolute in their numbers as he conceived
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the Preface does not commit itself, I
repeat, to the statement that all of these many plays are printed
from Shakespeare&rsquo;s own handwriting.&nbsp; After &ldquo;as
he conceived them,&rdquo; it goes on, &ldquo;Who, as he was a
most happy imitator of nature, was a <a name="page212"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 212</span>most gentle expresser of it.&nbsp;
His mind and hand went together: and what he thought he uttered
with that easiness, that we have scarce received from him a blot
in his papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This may be meant to <i>suggest</i>, but does not
<i>affirm</i>, that the actors <i>have</i> &ldquo;all the
rest&rdquo; of the plays in Shakespeare&rsquo;s own
handwriting.&nbsp; They may have, or may have had, some of his
manuscripts, and believed that other manuscripts accessible to
them, and used by them, contain his very words.&nbsp; Whether
from cunning or design, or from the Elizabethan inability to tell
a plain tale plainly, the authors or author of the Preface have
everywhere left themselves loopholes and ways of evasion and
escape.&nbsp; It is not possible to pin them down to any plain
statement of facts concerning the sources for the hitherto
unpublished plays, &ldquo;the rest&rdquo; of the plays.</p>
<p>These, at least, were from manuscript sources which the actors
thought accurate, and some may have been &ldquo;fair
copies&rdquo; in Shakespeare&rsquo;s own hand. (Scott, as regards
his novels, sent his <i>prima cura</i>, his first writing down,
to the press, and his pages are nearly free from blot or
erasion.&nbsp; In one case at least, Shelley&rsquo;s first draft
of a poem is described as like a marsh of reeds in water, with
wild ducks, but he made very elegant fair copies for the
press.)&nbsp; Let it be supposed that Ben Jonson wrote all this
Preface, in accordance with the wishes and instructions of the
two actors <a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>who sign it.&nbsp; He took their word for the almost
blotless MSS. which they received from Shakespeare.&nbsp; He
remarks, in his posthumously published <i>Discoveries</i> (notes,
memories, brief essays), &ldquo;I remember the players have
<i>often</i> mentioned it as an honour to Shakespeare, that in
his writing (whatsoever he penned) he never blotted out a
line.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Ben gives, we shall later see, his
habitual reply to this habitual boast.</p>
<p>As to the sources of such plays as had been &ldquo;maimed and
deformed by injurious impostors,&rdquo; and are now
&ldquo;offered cur&rsquo;d and perfect of their limbs,&rdquo;
&ldquo;it can be proved to demonstration,&rdquo; say the
Cambridge Editors, &ldquo;that several plays in the Folio were
printed from earlier quarto editions&rdquo; (but the players
secured a retreat on this point), &ldquo;and that in other cases
the quarto is more correctly printed, or from a better manuscript
than the Folio text, and therefore of higher
authority.&rdquo;&nbsp; <i>Hamlet</i>, in the Folio of 1623, when
it differs from the quarto of 1604, &ldquo;differs for the worse
in forty-seven places, while it differs for the better in twenty
places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Can the wit of man suggest any other explanation than that the
editing of the Folio was carelessly done; out of the best quartos
and MSS. in the theatre for acting purposes, and,&mdash;if the
players did not lie in what they &ldquo;often said,&rdquo; and if
they kept the originals,&mdash;out of some MSS. received from
Shakspere?&nbsp; Whether the two players themselves threw into
the press, after some hasty <a name="page214"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 214</span>botchings, whatever materials they
had, or whether they employed an Editor, a very wretched Editor,
or Editors, or whether the great Author, Bacon, himself was his
own Editor, the preparation of a text was infamously done.&nbsp;
The two actors, probably, I think, never read through the
proof-sheets, and took the word of the man whom they employed to
edit their materials, for gospel.&nbsp; The editing of the Folio
is so exquisitely careless that twelve printer&rsquo;s errors in
a quarto of 1622, of <i>Richard III</i>, appear in the Folio of
1623.&nbsp; Again, the <i>Merry Wives</i> of the Folio, is nearly
twice as long as the quarto of 1619, yet keeps old errors.</p>
<p>How can we explain the reckless retention of errors, and also
the large additions and improvements?&nbsp; Did the true author
(Bacon or Bungay) now edit his work, add much matter, and go
wrong forty-seven times where the quarto was right, and go right
twenty times when the quarto was wrong?&nbsp; Did he, for the
Folio of 1623, nearly double <i>The Merry Wives</i> in extent,
and also leave all the errors of the fourth quarto
uncorrected?</p>
<p>In that case how negligent was Bacon of his immortal
works!&nbsp; Now Bacon was a scholar, and this absurd conduct
cannot be imputed, I hope, to him.</p>
<p>Mr. Pollard is much more lenient than his fellow-scholars
towards the Editor or Editors of the Folio.&nbsp; He concludes
that &ldquo;manuscript copies of the plays were easily
procurable.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sixteen <a name="page215"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 215</span>out of the thirty-six plays existed
in quartos.&nbsp; Eight of the sixteen were not used for the
Folio; five were used, &ldquo;with additions, corrections, or
alterations&rdquo; (which must have been made from
manuscripts).&nbsp; Three quartos only were reprinted as they
stood.&nbsp; The Editors greatly preferred to use manuscript
copies; and showed this, Mr. Pollard thinks, by placing plays,
never before printed, in the most salient parts of the three sets
of dramas in their book. <a name="citation215a"></a><a
href="#footnote215a" class="citation">[215a]</a>&nbsp; They did
make an attempt to divide their plays into Acts and Scenes,
whereas the quartos, as a general rule, had been undivided.&nbsp;
But the Editors, I must say, had not the energy to carry out
their good intentions fully&mdash;or Bacon or Bungay, if the
author, wearied in well-doing.&nbsp; The work is least ill done
in the Comedies, and grows worse and worse as the Editor, or
Bacon, or Bungay becomes intolerably slack.</p>
<p>A great living author, who had a decent regard for his own
works, could never have made or passed this slovenly Folio.&nbsp;
Yet Mr. Greenwood argues that probably Bungay was still alive and
active, after Shakspere was dead and buried.&nbsp; (Mr.
Greenwood, of course, does not speak of Bungay, which I use as
short for his Great Unknown.)&nbsp; Thus, <i>Richard III</i> from
1597 to 1622 appeared in six quartos.&nbsp; It is immensely
improved in the Folio, and so are several other plays.&nbsp; Who
made the improvements, which the <a name="page216"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 216</span>Editors could only obtain in
manuscripts?&nbsp; If we say that Shakespeare made them in MS.,
Mr. Greenwood asks, &ldquo;What had he to work upon, since, after
selling his plays to his company, he did not preserve his
manuscript?&rdquo; <a name="citation216a"></a><a
href="#footnote216a" class="citation">[216a]</a>&nbsp; Now I do
not know that he did sell his plays to his company.&nbsp; We are
sure that Will got money for them, but we do not know what
arrangement he made with his company.&nbsp; He may have had an
author&rsquo;s rights in addition to a sum down, as later was
customary, and he had his regular share in the profits.&nbsp; Nor
am I possessed of information that &ldquo;he did not preserve his
manuscript.&rdquo;&nbsp; How can we know that?&nbsp; He may have
kept his first draft, he may have made a fair copy for himself,
as well as for the players, or may have had one made.&nbsp; He
may have worked on a copy possessed by the players; and the
publisher of the quartos of 1605, 1612, 1622, may not have been
allowed to use, or may not have asked for the latest manuscript
revised copy.&nbsp; The <i>Richard III</i> of the Folio contains,
with much new matter, the printer&rsquo;s errors of the quarto of
1622.&nbsp; I would account for this by supposing that the casual
Editor had just sense enough to add the new parts in a revised
manuscript to the quarto, and was far too lazy to correct the
printer&rsquo;s errors in the quarto.&nbsp; But Mr. Greenwood
asks whether &ldquo;the natural conclusion is not that
&lsquo;some person unknown&rsquo; took the Quarto of 1622,
revised it, <a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>added the new passages, and thus put it into the form
in which it appeared in 1623.&rdquo;&nbsp; This natural
conclusion means that the author, Bungay, was alive in 1622, and
put his additions and improvements of recent date into the quarto
of 1622, but never took the trouble to correct the errors in the
quarto.&nbsp; And so on in other plays similarly treated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Is it not a more natural conclusion that
&lsquo;Shakespeare&rsquo;&rdquo; (Bungay) &ldquo;himself revised
its publication, and that some part of this revision, at any
rate, was done after 1616 and before 1623.&rdquo; <a
name="citation217a"></a><a href="#footnote217a"
class="citation">[217a]</a></p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood, after criticising other systems, writes, <a
name="citation217b"></a><a href="#footnote217b"
class="citation">[217b]</a> &ldquo;There is, of course, another
hypothesis.&nbsp; It is that Shakespeare&rdquo; (meaning the real
author) &ldquo;did not die in 1616,&rdquo; and here follows the
usual notion that &ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo; was the &ldquo;<i>nom
de plume</i>&rdquo; of that transcendent genius, &ldquo;moving in
Court circles among the highest of his day (as assuredly
Shakespeare must have moved)&mdash;who wished to conceal his
identity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have not the shadow of assurance that the Author
&ldquo;moved in Court circles,&rdquo; though Will would see a
good deal when he played at Court, and in the houses of nobles,
before &ldquo;Eliza and our James.&rdquo;&nbsp; I never moved in
Court circles: Mr. Greenwood must know them better than I do, and
I have explained (see <i>Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s Lost</i>,
and <i>Shakespeare</i>, <i>Genius</i>, <i>and Society</i>) how
Will picked up his notions of courtly ways.</p>
<p><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>&ldquo;Another hypothesis,&rdquo; the Baconian
hypothesis,&mdash;&ldquo;<i>nom de plume</i>&rdquo; and
all,&mdash;Mr. Greenwood thinks &ldquo;an extremely reasonable
one&rdquo;: I cannot easily conceive of one more
unreasonable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supposing that there was such an author as I have
suggested, he may well have conceived the idea of publishing a
collected edition of the plays which had been written under the
name of Shakespeare, and being himself busy with other matters,
he may have entrusted the business to some &lsquo;literary
man,&rsquo; to some &lsquo;good pen,&rsquo; who was at the time
doing work for him; and why not to the man who wrote the
commendatory verses, the &lsquo;Lines to the Reader&rsquo;&rdquo;
(opposite to the engraving), &ldquo;and, as seems certain, the
Preface, &lsquo;to the great variety of Readers&rsquo;?&rdquo; <a
name="citation218a"></a><a href="#footnote218a"
class="citation">[218a]</a></p>
<p>That man, that &ldquo;good pen,&rdquo; was Ben Jonson.&nbsp;
On the &ldquo;supposing&rdquo; of Mr. Greenwood, Ben is
&ldquo;doing work for&rdquo; the Great Unknown at the time when
&ldquo;the business&rdquo; following on the &ldquo;idea of
publishing a collected edition of the plays which had been
written under the name of Shakespeare&rdquo; occurred to the
illustrious but unknown owner of that &ldquo;<i>nom de
plume</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; In plain words of my own,&mdash;the
Author may have entrusted &ldquo;the business,&rdquo; and what
was that business if not the editing of the Folio?&mdash;to Ben
Jonson&mdash;&ldquo;who was at the time doing work for
him&rdquo;&mdash;for the Author.</p>
<p>Here is a clue!&nbsp; We only need to know for <a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>what man of
&ldquo;transcendent genius, universal culture, world-wide
philosophy . . . moving in Court circles,&rdquo; and so on, Ben
&ldquo;was working&rdquo; about 1621&ndash;3, the Folio appearing
in 1623.</p>
<p>The heart beats with anticipation of a discovery!&nbsp;
&ldquo;On January 22, 1621, Bacon celebrated his sixtieth
birthday with great state at York House.&nbsp; Jonson was
present,&rdquo; and wrote an ode, with something about the Genius
of the House (<i>Lar</i> or Brownie),</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thou stand&rsquo;st as if some mystery thou
didst.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Greenwood does not know what this can mean; nor do I. <a
name="citation219a"></a><a href="#footnote219a"
class="citation">[219a]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Jonson, it appears&rdquo; (on what authority?),
&ldquo;was Bacon&rsquo;s guest at Gorhambury, and was one of
those good &lsquo;pens,&rsquo;&rdquo; of whom Bacon speaks as
assisting him in the translation of some of his books into
Latin.</p>
<p>Bacon, writing to Toby Mathew, June 26, 1623, mentions the
help of &ldquo;some good pens,&rdquo; Ben Jonson he does not
mention.&nbsp; But Judge Webb does.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is an
undoubted fact,&rdquo; says Judge Webb, &ldquo;that the Latin of
the <i>De Augmentis</i>, which was published in 1623, was the
work of Jonson.&rdquo; <a name="citation219b"></a><a
href="#footnote219b" class="citation">[219b]</a>&nbsp; To whom
Mr. Collins replies, &ldquo;There is not a particle of evidence
that Jonson gave to Bacon the smallest assistance in translating
any of his works into Latin.&rdquo; <a name="citation219c"></a><a
href="#footnote219c" class="citation">[219c]</a></p>
<p><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span><i>Tr&egrave;s bien</i>, on Judge Webb&rsquo;s
assurance the person for whom Ben was working, in 1623, was
Bacon.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s
&ldquo;supposing&rdquo; is &ldquo;that there was such an
author&rdquo; (of transcendent genius, and so on), who &ldquo;may
have entrusted the editing of his collected plays&rdquo; to some
&ldquo;good pen,&rdquo; who was at the time &ldquo;doing work for
him,&rdquo; and &ldquo;why not to&rdquo;&mdash;Ben Jonson. <a
name="citation220a"></a><a href="#footnote220a"
class="citation">[220a]</a>&nbsp; Now the man for whom Ben, in
1623, was &ldquo;doing work&rdquo;&mdash;was <span
class="smcap">Bacon</span>,&mdash;so Judge Webb says. <a
name="citation220b"></a><a href="#footnote220b"
class="citation">[220b]</a></p>
<p>Therefore, by this hypothesis of Mr. Greenwood, <a
name="citation220c"></a><a href="#footnote220c"
class="citation">[220c]</a> the Great Unknown was
Bacon,&mdash;just the hypothesis of the common Baconian.</p>
<p>Is my reasoning erroneous?&nbsp; Is the
&ldquo;supposing&rdquo; suggested by Mr. Greenwood <a
name="citation220d"></a><a href="#footnote220d"
class="citation">[220d]</a> any other than that of Miss Delia
Bacon, and Judge Webb?&nbsp; True, Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s Baconian
&ldquo;supposing&rdquo; is only a working hypothesis: not a
confirmed belief.&nbsp; But it is useful to his argument (see
&ldquo;Ben Jonson and Shakespeare&rdquo;) when he wants to
explain away Ben&rsquo;s evidence, in his verses in the Folio, to
the Stratford actor as the Author.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood writes, in the first page of his Preface:
&ldquo;It is no part of my plan or intention to defend that
theory,&rdquo; &ldquo;the Baconian theory.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Apparently it pops out contrary to the intention of Mr.
Greenwood.&nbsp; But pop out it does: at least I can find no flaw
in the reasoning of my detection of Bacon: I see no way out of it
except this: <a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>after recapitulating what is said about Ben as one of
Bacon&rsquo;s &ldquo;good pens&rdquo; with other details, Mr.
Greenwood says, &ldquo;But no doubt that way madness lies!&rdquo;
<a name="citation221a"></a><a href="#footnote221a"
class="citation">[221a]</a>&nbsp; Ah no! not madness, no, but
Baconism &ldquo;lies that way.&rdquo;&nbsp; However, &ldquo;let
it be granted&rdquo; (as Euclid says in his sportsmanlike way)
that Mr. Greenwood by no means thinks that his &ldquo;concealed
poet&rdquo; is Bacon&mdash;only some one similar and similarly
situated and still active in 1623, and occupied with other
business than supervising a collected edition of plays written
under his &ldquo;<i>nom de plume</i>&rdquo; of Shakespeare.&nbsp;
Bacon, too, was busy, with supervising, or toiling at the Latin
translation of his scientific works, and Ben (according to Judge
Webb) was busy in turning the <i>Advancement of Learning</i> into
Latin prose.&nbsp; Mr. Greenwood quotes, without reference,
Archbishop Tenison as saying that Ben helped Bacon in doing his
works into Latin. <a name="citation221b"></a><a
href="#footnote221b" class="citation">[221b]</a>&nbsp; Tenison is
a very late witness.&nbsp; The prophetic soul of Bacon did not
quite trust English to last as long as Latin, or he thought
Latin, the <i>lingua franca</i> of Europe in his day, more easily
accessible to foreign students, as, of course, it was.&nbsp; Thus
Bacon was very busy; so was Ben.&nbsp; The sad consequence of
Ben&rsquo;s business, perhaps, is that the editing of the Folio
is notoriously bad; whether Ben were the Editor or not, it is
infamously bad.</p>
<p>Conceivably Mr. Greenwood is of the same <a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span>opinion.&nbsp; He says, &ldquo;It stands admitted that
a very large part of that volume&rdquo; (the Folio)
&ldquo;consists of work that is not
&lsquo;Shakespeare&rsquo;s&rsquo; at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How strange, if Ben edited it for the Great Unknown&mdash;who
knew, if any human being knew, what work was
&ldquo;Shakespeare&rsquo;s&rdquo;!&nbsp; On Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s
hypothesis, <a name="citation222a"></a><a href="#footnote222a"
class="citation">[222a]</a> or &ldquo;supposing,&rdquo; the
Unknown Author &ldquo;may well have conceived the idea of
publishing a collected edition of the plays which had been
written&rdquo; (not &ldquo;published,&rdquo; <i>written</i>)
&ldquo;under the name of Shakespeare, and, being himself busy
with other matters, he may have entrusted the business to&rdquo;
some &ldquo;good pen,&rdquo; &ldquo;and why not
to&rdquo;&mdash;Ben.&nbsp; Nevertheless &ldquo;a very large part
of that volume consists of work that is not
&lsquo;Shakespeare&rsquo;s&rsquo; at all.&rdquo; <a
name="citation222b"></a><a href="#footnote222b"
class="citation">[222b]</a>&nbsp; How did this occur?&nbsp; The
book <a name="citation222c"></a><a href="#footnote222c"
class="citation">[222c]</a> is &ldquo;that very doubtful
&lsquo;canon.&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; How, if
&ldquo;Shakespeare&rsquo;s&rdquo; man edited it for
&ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo;?&nbsp; Did &ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo;
not care what stuff was placed under his immortal &ldquo;<i>nom
de plume</i>&rdquo;?</p>
<p>It is not my fault if I think that Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s
hypotheses <a name="citation222d"></a><a href="#footnote222d"
class="citation">[222d]</a>&mdash;the genuine
&ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo; either revised his own works, or put
Ben on the editorial task&mdash;are absolutely contradicted by
his statements in another part of his book. <a
name="citation222e"></a><a href="#footnote222e"
class="citation">[222e]</a>&nbsp; For the genuine
&ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo; knew what plays he had <a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>written,
knew what he could honestly put forth as his own, as
&ldquo;Shakespeare&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp; Or, if he placed the
task of editing in Ben&rsquo;s hands, he must have told Ben what
plays were of his own making.&nbsp; In either case the Folio
would contain these, and no others.&nbsp; But&mdash;&ldquo;the
<i>plat contraire</i>,&rdquo;&mdash;the very reverse,&mdash;is
stated by Mr. Greenwood.&nbsp; &ldquo;It stands admitted that a
very large portion of that volume&rdquo; (the Folio)
&ldquo;consists of work that is not
&lsquo;Shakespeare&rsquo;s&rsquo;&rdquo; (is not Bacon&rsquo;s,
or the other man&rsquo;s) &ldquo;at all.&rdquo; <a
name="citation223a"></a><a href="#footnote223a"
class="citation">[223a]</a>&nbsp; Then away fly the hypotheses <a
name="citation223b"></a><a href="#footnote223b"
class="citation">[223b]</a> that the auto-Shakespeare, or that
Ben, employed by the auto-Shakespeare (apparently Bacon) revised,
edited, and prepared for publication the auto-Shakespearean
plays.&nbsp; For Mr. Greenwood &ldquo;has already dealt with
<i>Titus</i> (<i>Andronicus</i>) and <i>Henry VI</i>,&rdquo; <a
name="citation223c"></a><a href="#footnote223c"
class="citation">[223c]</a> and proved them not to be
auto-Shakespearean&mdash;and he adds &ldquo;there are many other
plays in that very doubtful &lsquo;canon&rsquo;&rdquo; (the
Folio) &ldquo;which, by universal admission, contain much
non-Shakespearean composition.&rdquo; <a
name="citation223d"></a><a href="#footnote223d"
class="citation">[223d]</a>&nbsp; Perhaps! but if so the two
hypotheses, <a name="citation223e"></a><a href="#footnote223e"
class="citation">[223e]</a> that either the genuine Shakespeare
<a name="citation223f"></a><a href="#footnote223f"
class="citation">[223f]</a> revised (&ldquo;is it not a more
natural solution that &lsquo;Shakespeare&rsquo; himself revised
his works for publication, and that some part, at any rate, of
this revision <a name="citation223g"></a><a href="#footnote223g"
class="citation">[223g]</a> was done after 1616 and before
1623?&rdquo;), or <a name="citation223h"></a><a
href="#footnote223h" class="citation">[223h]</a> that he gave Ben
(who was working, by the conjecture, for Bacon) the task of <a
name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>editing the
Folio,&mdash;are annihilated.&nbsp; For neither the
auto-Shakespeare (if honest), nor Ben (if sober), could have
stuffed the Folio full of non-Shakespearean work,&mdash;including
four &ldquo;non-Shakespearean&rdquo; plays,&mdash;nor could the
Folio be &ldquo;that very doubtful canon.&rdquo; <a
name="citation224a"></a><a href="#footnote224a"
class="citation">[224a]</a>&nbsp; Again, if either the
auto-Shakespeare or Ben following his instructions, were Editor,
neither could have, as the Folio Editor had &ldquo;evidently no
little doubt about&rdquo; <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>. <a
name="citation224b"></a><a href="#footnote224b"
class="citation">[224b]</a></p>
<p>Neither Ben, nor the actual Simon Pure, the author, the
auto-Shakespeare, could fail to know the truth about <i>Trodus
and Cressida</i>.&nbsp; But the Editor <a
name="citation224c"></a><a href="#footnote224c"
class="citation">[224c]</a> did <i>not</i> know the truth, the
whole canon is &ldquo;doubtful.&rdquo;&nbsp; Therefore the
hypothesis, the &ldquo;supposing,&rdquo; that the actual author
did the revising, <a name="citation224d"></a><a
href="#footnote224d" class="citation">[224d]</a> and the other
hypothesis that he gave Ben the work, <a
name="citation224e"></a><a href="#footnote224e"
class="citation">[224e]</a> seem to me wholly impossible.&nbsp;
But Mr. Greenwood needs the &ldquo;supposings&rdquo; of pp. 290,
293; and as he rejects <i>Titus Andronicus</i> and <i>Henry
VI</i> (both in the Folio), he also needs the contradictory views
of pp. 351, 358.&nbsp; On which set of supposings and averments
does he stand to win?</p>
<p>Perhaps he thinks to find a way out of what appears to me to
be a dilemma in the following fashion: He will not accept
<i>Titus Andronicus</i> and <i>Henry VI</i>, though both are in
the Folio, as the work of <i>his</i> &ldquo;Shakespeare,&rdquo;
his Unknown, <a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
225</span>the Bacon of the Baconians.&nbsp; Well, we ask, if your
Unknown, or Bacon, or Ben,&mdash;instructed by Bacon, or by the
Unknown,&mdash;edited the Folio, how could any one of the three
insert <i>Titus</i>, and <i>Henry VI</i>, and be &ldquo;in no
little doubt about&rdquo; <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>?&nbsp;
Bacon, or the Unknown, or the Editor employed by either, knew
perfectly well which plays either man could honestly claim as his
own work, done under the &ldquo;<i>nom de plume</i>&rdquo; of
&ldquo;William Shakespeare&rdquo; (with or without the
hyphen).&nbsp; Yet the Editor of the Folio does not
know&mdash;and Mr. Greenwood does know&mdash;<i>Henry VI</i> and
<i>Titus</i> are &ldquo;wrong ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s way out, if I follow him, is this: <a
name="citation225a"></a><a href="#footnote225a"
class="citation">[225a]</a> &ldquo;Judge Stotsenburg asks,
&lsquo;Who wrote <i>The Taming of a Shrew</i> printed in 1594,
and who wrote <i>Titus Andronicus</i>, <i>Henry VI</i>, or
<i>King Lear</i> referred to in the Diary?&rsquo;&rdquo;
(Henslowe&rsquo;s).&nbsp; The Judge continues: &ldquo;Neither
Collier nor any of the Shaxper commentators make (<i>sic</i>) any
claim to their authorship in behalf of William Shaxper.&nbsp;
Since these plays have the same names as those included in the
Folio of 1623 the presumption is that they are the same plays
until the contrary is shown.&nbsp; Of course it may be shown,
either that those in the Folio are entirely different except in
name, or that these plays were revised, improved, and dressed by
some one whom they&rdquo; (who?) &ldquo;called
Shakespeare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood says, &ldquo;My own conviction is <a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>that . . .
these plays were &lsquo;revised, improved, and dressed by some
one whom they called Shakespeare.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a
name="citation226a"></a><a href="#footnote226a"
class="citation">[226a]</a>&nbsp; (Whom <i>who</i> called
Shakespeare?)&nbsp; In that case these plays,&mdash;say <i>Titus
Andronicus</i> and <i>Henry VI</i>, Part 1,&mdash;which Mr.
Greenwood denies to <i>his</i> &ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo; were
just as much <i>his</i> Shakespeare&rsquo;s plays as any other
plays (and there are several), which <i>his</i> Shakespeare
&ldquo;revised, improved, and dressed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet
<i>his</i> Shakespeare is <i>not</i> author of <i>Henry VI</i>,
<a name="citation226b"></a><a href="#footnote226b"
class="citation">[226b]</a> not the author of <i>Titus
Andronicus</i>. <a name="citation226c"></a><a
href="#footnote226c" class="citation">[226c]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr.
Anders,&rdquo; writes Mr. Greenwood, &ldquo;makes what I think to
be a great error in citing <i>Henry VI</i> and <i>Titus</i> as
genuine plays of Shakespeare.&rdquo; <a
name="citation226d"></a><a href="#footnote226d"
class="citation">[226d]</a></p>
<p>He hammers at this denial in nineteen references in his Index
to <i>Titus Andronicus</i>.&nbsp; Yet Ben, or Bacon, or the
Unknown thought that these plays <i>were</i> &ldquo;genuine
plays&rdquo; of &ldquo;Shakespeare,&rdquo; the concealed
author&mdash;Bacon or Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s man.&nbsp; It appears
that the immense poet who used the &ldquo;<i>nom de
plume</i>&rdquo; of &ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo; did not know the
plays of which he could rightfully call himself the author; that
(not foreseeing Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s constantly repeated
objections) he boldly annexed four plays, or two certainly, which
Mr. Greenwood denies to him, and another about which &ldquo;the
Folio Editor was in no little doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>Finally, <a name="citation227a"></a><a
href="#footnote227a" class="citation">[227a]</a> Mr. Greenwood is
&ldquo;convinced,&rdquo; &ldquo;it is my conviction&rdquo; that
some plays which he often denies to his &ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo;
were &ldquo;revised, improved, and dressed by some one whom they
called Shakespeare.&rdquo;&nbsp; That some one, if he edited or
caused to be edited the Folio, thought that his revision,
improvement, and dressing up of the plays gave him a right to
claim their authorship&mdash;and Mr. Greenwood, a dozen times and
more, denies to him their authorship.</p>
<p>One is seriously puzzled to discover the critic&rsquo;s
meaning.&nbsp; <i>The Taming of a Shrew</i>, <i>Titus</i>,
<i>Henry VI</i>, and <i>King Lear</i>, referred to in
Henslowe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Diary,&rdquo; are not
&ldquo;Shakespearean,&rdquo; we are repeatedly told.&nbsp; But
&ldquo;my own conviction is that . . . &rdquo; these plays were
&ldquo;revised, improved, and dressed by some one whom they
called Shakespeare.&rdquo;&nbsp; But to be revised, improved, and
dressed by some one whom they called Shakespeare, is to be as
truly &ldquo;Shakespearean&rdquo; work as is any play so handled
&ldquo;by Shakespeare.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus the plays mentioned are
as truly &ldquo;Shakespearean&rdquo; as any others in which
&ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo; worked on an earlier canvas, and also
<i>Titus</i> &ldquo;is not <i>Shakespearean</i> at
all.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Greenwood, I repeat, constantly denies the
&ldquo;Shakespearean&rdquo; character to <i>Titus</i> and
<i>Henry VI</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;The conclusion of the whole matter
is that <i>Titus</i> and <i>The Trilogy of Henry VI</i> are not
the work of Shakespeare: that his hand is <a
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>probably
not to be found at all in <i>Titus</i>, and only once or twice,
if at all, in <i>Henry VI</i>, Part I, but that he it probably
was who altered and remodelled the two parts of the old
<i>Contention of the Houses of York and Lancaster</i>, thereby
producing <i>Henry VI</i>, Parts II and III.&rdquo; <a
name="citation228a"></a><a href="#footnote228a"
class="citation">[228a]</a></p>
<p>Yet <a name="citation228b"></a><a href="#footnote228b"
class="citation">[228b]</a> <i>Titus</i> and <i>Henry VI</i>
appear as &ldquo;revised, improved, and dressed&rdquo; by the
mysterious &ldquo;some one whom they called
Shakespeare.&rdquo;&nbsp; If Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s conclusion <a
name="citation228c"></a><a href="#footnote228c"
class="citation">[228c]</a> be correct, &ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo;
had no right to place <i>Henry VI</i>, Part I, and <i>Titus</i>
in his Folio.&nbsp; If his &ldquo;conviction&rdquo; <a
name="citation228d"></a><a href="#footnote228d"
class="citation">[228d]</a> be correct, Shakespeare had as good a
right to them as to any of the plays which he revised, and
improved, and dressed.&nbsp; They <i>must</i> be
&ldquo;Shakespearean&rdquo; if Mr. Greenwood is right <a
name="citation228e"></a><a href="#footnote228e"
class="citation">[228e]</a> in his suggestion that
&ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo; either revised his works for
publication between 1616 and 1623, or set his man, Ben Jonson,
upon that business.&nbsp; Yet neither one nor the other knew what
to make of <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Folio
Editor had, evidently, no little doubt about that play.&rdquo; <a
name="citation228f"></a><a href="#footnote228f"
class="citation">[228f]</a></p>
<p>So neither &ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo; nor Ben, instructed by
him, can have been &ldquo;the Folio Editor.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Consequently Mr. Greenwood must abandon his suggestion that
either man was the Editor, and may return to his rejection of
<i>Titus</i> and <i>Henry VI</i>, <a name="page229"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 229</span>Part I.&nbsp; But he clings to
it.&nbsp; He finds in Henslowe&rsquo;s Diary &ldquo;references
to, and records of the writing of, such plays&rdquo; as, among
others, <i>Titus Andronicus</i>, and <i>Henry VI</i>. <a
name="citation229a"></a><a href="#footnote229a"
class="citation">[229a]</a></p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood, after rejecting a theory of some one, says,
&ldquo;Far more likely does it appear that there was a great man
of the time whose genius was capable of &lsquo;transforming dross
into gold,&rsquo; who took these plays, and, in great part,
rewrote and revised them, leaving sometimes more, and sometimes
less of the original work; and that so rewritten, revised, and
transformed they appeared as the plays of
&lsquo;Shake-speare.&rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation229b"></a><a
href="#footnote229b" class="citation">[229b]</a></p>
<p>This statement is made <a name="citation229c"></a><a
href="#footnote229c" class="citation">[229c]</a> about
&ldquo;these plays,&rdquo; including <i>Titus Andronicus</i> and
<i>Henry VI</i>, while <a name="citation229d"></a><a
href="#footnote229d" class="citation">[229d]</a>
&ldquo;<i>Titus</i> and the <i>Trilogy of Henry VI</i> are not
the work of Shakespeare . . . his hand is probably not to be
found at all in <i>Titus</i>, and only once or twice in <i>Henry
VI</i>, Part I,&rdquo; though he probably made Parts II and III
out of older plays.</p>
<p>I do not know where to have the critic.&nbsp; If <i>Henry
VI</i>, Part I, and <i>Titus</i> are in no sense by
&ldquo;Shakespeare,&rdquo; then neither &ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo;
nor Ben for him edited or had anything to do with the editing of
the Folio.&nbsp; If either or both had to do with the editing, as
the critic suggests, then <a name="page230"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 230</span>he is wrong in denying Shakespearean
origin to <i>Titus</i> and <i>Henry VI</i>, Part I.</p>
<p>Of course one sees a way out of the dilemma for the great
auto-Shakespeare himself, who, by one hypothesis, handed over the
editing of his plays to Ben (<i>he</i>, by Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s
&ldquo;supposing,&rdquo; was deviling at literary jobs for
Bacon).&nbsp; The auto-Shakespeare merely tells Ben to edit his
plays, and never even gives him a list of them.&nbsp; Then Ben
brings him the Folio, and the author looks at the list of
Plays.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Jonson,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;I have hitherto held
thee for an honest scholar and a deserving man in the quality
thou dost profess.&nbsp; But thou hast brought me a maimed and
deformed printed copy of that which I did write for my own
recreation, not wishful to be known for so light a thing as a
poet.&nbsp; Moreover, thou hast placed among these my trifles,
four plays to which I never put a finger, and others in which I
had no more than a thumb.&nbsp; The Seneschal, Mr. Jonson, will
pay thee what is due to thee; thy fardels shall be sent
whithersoever thou wilt, and, Mary!&nbsp; Mr. Jonson, I bid thee
never more be officer of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This painful discourse must have been held at
Gorhambury,&mdash;if Ben edited the Folio&mdash;for Francis.</p>
<p>It is manifest, I hope, that about the Folio Mr. Greenwood
speaks with two voices, and these very discordant.&nbsp; It is
also manifest that, whoever wrote the plays left his materials in
deep <a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
231</span>neglect, and that, when they were collected, some one
gathered them up in extreme disorder.&nbsp; It is extraordinary
that the Baconians and Mr. Greenwood do not see the fallacy of
their own reasoning in this matter of the Folio.&nbsp; They
constantly ridicule the old view that the actor, Will Shakspere
(if, by miracle, he were the author of the plays), could have
left them to take their fortunes.&nbsp; They are asked, what did
other playwrights do in that age?&nbsp; They often parted with
their whole copyright to the actors of this or that company, or
to Henslowe.&nbsp; The new owners could alter the plays at will,
and were notoriously anxious to keep them out of print, lest
other companies should act them.&nbsp; As Mr. Greenwood writes,
<a name="citation231a"></a><a href="#footnote231a"
class="citation">[231a]</a> &ldquo;Such, we are told, was the
universal custom with dramatists of the day; they &lsquo;kept no
copies&rsquo; of their plays, and thought no more about
them.&nbsp; It will, I suppose, be set down to fanaticism that I
should doubt the truth of this proposition, that I doubt if it be
consonant with the known facts of human nature.&rdquo;&nbsp; But
whom, except Jonson, does Mr. Greenwood find editing and
publishing his plays?&nbsp; Beaumont, Fletcher, Heywood?&nbsp;
No!</p>
<p>If the Great Unknown were dead in 1623, his negligence was as
bad as Will&rsquo;s.&nbsp; If he were alive and revised his own
work for publication, <a name="citation231b"></a><a
href="#footnote231b" class="citation">[231b]</a> he did it as the
office cat might have done it in <a name="page232"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 232</span>hours of play.&nbsp; If, on the
other side, he handed the editorial task over to Ben, <a
name="citation232a"></a><a href="#footnote232a"
class="citation">[232a]</a> then he did not even give Ben a list
of his genuine works.&nbsp; Mr. Greenwood cites the case of Ben
Jonson, a notorious and, I think, solitary exception.&nbsp; Ben
was and often proclaimed himself to be essentially a
scholar.&nbsp; He took as much pains in prefacing, editing, and
annotating his plays, as he would have taken had the texts been
those of Greek tragedians.</p>
<p>Finally, all Baconians cry out against the sottish behaviour
of the actor, Will, if being really the author of the plays, he
did not bestir himself, and bring them out in a collected
edition.&nbsp; Yet no English dramatist ventured on doing such a
thing, till Ben thus collected his &ldquo;works&rdquo; (and was
laughed at) in 1616.&nbsp; The example might have encouraged Will
to be up and doing, but he died early in 1616.&nbsp; If Will were
<i>not</i> the author, what care was Bacon, or the Unknown,
taking of his many manuscript plays, and for the proper editing
of those which had appeared separately in pamphlets?&nbsp; As
indolent and casual as Will, the great Author, Bacon or another,
left the plays to take their chances.&nbsp; Mr. Greenwood says
that &ldquo;<i>if the author</i>&rdquo; (Bacon or somebody very
like him) &ldquo;<i>had been careless about keeping copies of his
manuscripts</i> . . . &rdquo; <a name="citation232b"></a><a
href="#footnote232b" class="citation">[232b]</a>&nbsp; What an
&ldquo;if&rdquo; in the case of the great Author!&nbsp; This
gross <a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>neglect, infamous in Will, may thus have been practised
by the Great Unknown himself.</p>
<p>In 1911 Mr. Greenwood writes, &ldquo;There is overwhelming
authority for the view that <i>Titus Andronicus</i> is not
<i>Shakespearean</i> at all.&rdquo; <a name="citation233a"></a><a
href="#footnote233a" class="citation">[233a]</a>&nbsp; In that
case, neither Bacon, nor the Unknown, nor Ben, acting for either,
can have been the person who put <i>Titus</i> into the Folio.</p>
<h2><a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<span class="GutSmall">BEN JONSON AND SHAKESPEARE</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> evidence of Ben Jonson to the
identity of Shakespeare the author with Shakspere the actor, is
&ldquo;the strength of the Stratfordian faith,&rdquo; says Mr.
Greenwood.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I think it will be admitted that the
various Jonsonian utterances with regard to
&lsquo;Shakespeare&rsquo; are by no means easy to reconcile one
with the other.&rdquo; <a name="citation237a"></a><a
href="#footnote237a" class="citation">[237a]</a></p>
<p>It is difficult to reply briefly to Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s
forty-seven pages about the evidence of Jonson.&nbsp; But, first,
whenever in written words or in reported conversation, Ben speaks
of Shakespeare by name, he speaks of his <i>works</i>: in 1619 to
Drummond of Hawthornden; in 1623 in commendatory verses to the
Folio; while, about 1630, probably, in his posthumously published
<i>Discourses</i>, he writes on Shakespeare as the friend and
&ldquo;fellow&rdquo; of the players, on Shakespeare as his own
friend, and as a dramatist.&nbsp; On each of these three
occasions, Ben&rsquo;s <i>tone</i> varies.&nbsp; In 1619 he said
no more to Drummond of Hawthornden (apparently on two separate
occasions) than that Shakespeare &ldquo;lacked art,&rdquo; and
made the mistake about a wreck on the sea-coast of Bohemia.</p>
<p><a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>In
1619, Ben spoke gruffly and briefly of Shakespeare, as to
Drummond he also spoke disparagingly of Beaumont, whom he had
panegyrised in an epigram in his own folio of 1616, and was again
to praise in the commendatory verses in the Folio.&nbsp; He spoke
still more harshly of Drayton, whom in 1616 he had compared to
Homer, Virgil, Theocritus, and Tyr&aelig;us!&nbsp; He told an
unkind anecdote of Marston, with whom he had first quarrelled and
then made friends, collaborating with him in a play; and very
generously and to his great peril, sharing his
imprisonment.&nbsp; To Drummond, Jonson merely said that he
&ldquo;beat Marston and took away his pistol.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of Sir
John Beaumont, brother of the dramatist, Ben had written a most
hyperbolical eulogy in verse; luckily for Sir John, to Drummond
Ben did not speak of him.&nbsp; Such was Ben, in panegyric verse
hyperbolical; in conversation &ldquo;a despiser of others, and
praiser of himself.&rdquo;&nbsp; Compare Ben&rsquo;s three
remarks about Donne, all made to Drummond.&nbsp; Donne deserved
hanging for breaking metre; Donne would perish for not being
understood: and Donne was in some points the first of living
poets.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s effort to disable Jonson&rsquo;s
evidence rests on the contradictions in his estimates of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s poetry, in notices scattered through some
thirty years.&nbsp; Jonson, it is argued, cannot on each occasion
mean Will.&nbsp; He must now mean Will, now the Great Unknown,
and <a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>now&mdash;both at once.&nbsp; Yet I have proved that
Ben was the least consistent of critics, all depended on the
occasion, and on his humour at the moment.&nbsp; This is a
commonplace of literary history.&nbsp; The Baconians do not know
it; Mr. Greenwood, if he knows it, ignores it, and bases his
argument on facts which may be unknown to his readers.&nbsp; We
have noted Ben&rsquo;s words of 1619, and touched on his
panegyric of 1623.&nbsp; Thirdly, about 1630 probably, Ben wrote
in his manuscript book <i>Discourses</i> an affectionate but
critical page on Shakespeare as a man and an author.&nbsp;
Always, in prose, and in verse, and in recorded conversation, Ben
explicitly identified Shakspere (William, of Stratford) with the
author of the plays usually ascribed to him.&nbsp; But the
Baconian Judge Webb (in extreme old age), and the
anti-Shakespearean Mr. Greenwood and others, choose to interpret
Ben&rsquo;s words on the theory that, in 1623, he &ldquo;had his
tongue in his cheek&rdquo;; that, like Odysseus, he
&ldquo;mingled things false with true,&rdquo; that <i>they</i>
know what is true from what is false, and can undo the many knots
which Ben tied in his tongue.&nbsp; How they succeed we shall
see.</p>
<p>In addition to his three known mentions of Shakespeare by name
(1619, 1623, 1630?), Ben certainly appears to satirise his rival
at a much earlier date; especially as Pantalabus, a playwright in
<i>The Poetaster</i> (1601), and as actor, poet, and plagiarist
in an epigram, <i>Poet-Ape</i>, published in his collected works
of 1616; but probably <a name="page240"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 240</span>written as early as 1602.&nbsp; It
is well known that in 1598 Shakespeare&rsquo;s company acted
Ben&rsquo;s <i>Every Man in His Humour</i>.&nbsp; It appears that
he conceived some grudge against the actors, and apparently
against Shakespeare and other playwrights, for, in 1601, his
<i>Poetaster</i> is a satire both on playwrights and on actors,
whom he calls &ldquo;apes.&rdquo;&nbsp; The apparent attacks on
Shakespeare are just such as Ben, if angry and envious, would
direct against him; while we know of no other poet-player of the
period to whom they could apply.&nbsp; For example, in <i>The
Poetaster</i>, Histrio, the actor, is advised to ingratiate
himself with <i>Pantalabus</i>, &ldquo;gent&rsquo;man
parcel-poet, his father was a man of worship, I tell
thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is perhaps unmistakably a blow at
Shakespeare, who had recently acquired for his father and himself
arms, and the pleasure of writing himself
&ldquo;gentleman.&rdquo;&nbsp; This &ldquo;parcel-poet
gent&rsquo;man&rdquo; &ldquo;pens lofty, in a new stalking
style,&rdquo;&mdash;he is thus an author, he &ldquo;pens,&rdquo;
and in a high style.&nbsp; He is called <i>Pantalabus</i>, from
the Greek words for &ldquo;to <i>take up all</i>,&rdquo; which
means that, as poet, he is a plagiarist.&nbsp; Jonson repeats
this charge in his verses called <i>Poet-Ape</i>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>He takes up all</i>, makes each
man&rsquo;s wit his own,<br />
And told of this, he slights it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a scene added to <i>The Poetaster</i> in 1616, the author
(Ben) is advised not</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;With a sad and serious verse to wound<br />
Pantalabus, railing in his saucy jests,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>and
obviously slighting the charges of plagiarism.&nbsp; Perhaps Ben
is glancing at Shakespeare, who, if accused of plagiary by an
angry rival, would merely laugh.</p>
<p>A reply to the <i>Poetaster</i>, namely <i>Satiromastix</i>
(by Dekker and Marston?), introduces Jonson himself as babbling
darkly about &ldquo;Mr. Justice Shallow,&rdquo; and &ldquo;an
Innocent Moor&rdquo; (Othello?).&nbsp; Here is question of
&ldquo;administering strong pills&rdquo; to Jonson;
<i>then</i>,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;What lumps of hard and indigested stuff,<br
/>
Of bitter <i>Satirism</i>, of <i>Arrogance</i>,<br />
Of <i>Self-love</i>, of <i>Detraction</i>, of a black<br />
And stinking <i>Insolence</i> should we fetch up!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This &ldquo;pill&rdquo; is a reply to Ben&rsquo;s
&ldquo;purge&rdquo; for the poets in his <i>Poetaster</i>.&nbsp;
Oh, the sad old stuff!</p>
<p>Referring to Jonson&rsquo;s <i>Poetaster</i>, and to
<i>Satiromastix</i>, the counter-attack, we find a passage in the
Cambridge play, <i>The Return from Parnassus</i> (about
1602).&nbsp; Burbage, the tragic actor, and Kempe, the low-comedy
man of Shakespeare&rsquo;s company, are introduced, discussing
the possible merits of Cambridge wits as playwrights.&nbsp; Kempe
rejects them as they &ldquo;smell too much of that writer Ovid,
and that writer Metamorphosis . . . &rdquo;&nbsp; The purpose, of
course, is to laugh at the ignorance of the low-comedy man, who
thinks &ldquo;Metamorphosis&rdquo; a writer, and does not
suspect&mdash;how should he?&mdash;that Shakespeare &ldquo;smells
of Ovid.&rdquo;&nbsp; Kempe innocently goes on, &ldquo;Why,
here&rsquo;s our fellow&rdquo; (comrade) &ldquo;Shakespeare puts
them all <a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
242</span>down&rdquo; (all the University playwrights),
&ldquo;aye, and Ben Jonson too.&nbsp; O that Ben Jonson is a
pestilent fellow, he brought up Horace&rdquo; (in <i>The
Poetaster</i>) &ldquo;giving the poets a pill, but our fellow
Shakespeare hath given him a purge . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>The Cambridge author, perhaps, is thinking of the pill (not
purge) which, in <i>Satiromastix</i>, might be administered to
Jonson.&nbsp; The Cambridge author may have thought that
Shakespeare wrote the passage on the pill which was to
&ldquo;fetch up&rdquo; masses of Ben&rsquo;s insolence,
self-love, arrogance, and detraction.&nbsp; If this be not the
sequence of ideas, it is not easy to understand how or why Kempe
is made to say that Shakespeare has given Jonson a purge.&nbsp;
Stupid old nonsense!&nbsp; There are other more or less obscure
indications of Jonson&rsquo;s spite, during the stage-quarrel,
against Shakespeare, but the most unmistakable proof lies in his
verses in &ldquo;Poet-Ape.&rdquo;&nbsp; I am aware that
Ben&rsquo;s intention here to hit at Shakespeare has been denied,
for example by Mr. Collins with his usual vigour of
language.&nbsp; But though I would fain agree with him, the
object of attack can be no known person save Will.&nbsp; Jonson
was already, in <i>The Poetaster</i>, using the term
&ldquo;<i>Poet-Ape</i>,&rdquo; for he calls the actors at large
&ldquo;apes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jonson thought so well of his rhymes that he included them in
the Epigrams of his first Folio (1616).&nbsp; By that date, the
year of Shakespeare&rsquo;s death, if he really loved
Shakespeare, as he says, in verse and prose, Ben might have <a
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>suppressed
the verses.&nbsp; But (as Drummond noted) he preferred his jest,
such as it was, to his friend; who was not, as usually
understood, a man apt to resent a very blunt shaft of very
obsolete wit.&nbsp; Like Moli&egrave;re, Shakespeare had outlived
the charge of plagiarism, made long ago by the jealous Ben.</p>
<p>Poet-Ape is an actor-playwright &ldquo;<i>that would be
thought our chief</i>&rdquo;&mdash;words which, by 1601, could
only apply to Shakespeare; there was no rival, save Ben, near his
throne.&nbsp; The playwright-actor, too, has now confessedly</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;grown<br />
To a little wealth and credit in the scene,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>of no other actor-playwright could this be said.</p>
<p>He is the author of &ldquo;works&rdquo; (Jonson was laughed at
for calling his own plays &ldquo;works&rdquo;), but these works
are &ldquo;the frippery of wit,&rdquo; that is, a tissue of
plagiarisms, as in the case of <i>Pantalabus</i>.&nbsp; But
&ldquo;told of this he slights it,&rdquo; as most successful
authors, when accused, as they often are, of plagiarism by
jealous rivals, wisely do;&mdash;so did Moli&egrave;re.&nbsp;
This Poet-Ape began his career by &ldquo;picking and
gleaning&rdquo; and &ldquo;buying reversions of old
plays.&rdquo;&nbsp; This means that Shakespeare <i>did</i> work
over earlier plays which his company had acquired; or, if
Shakespeare did not,&mdash;then, I presume,&mdash;Bacon did!</p>
<p><i>That</i>, with much bad humour, is the gist of the rhymes
on Poet-Ape.&nbsp; Ben thinks Shakespeare&rsquo;s
&ldquo;works&rdquo; very larcenous, but still, the
&ldquo;works,&rdquo; as such, are those of the poet-actor.&nbsp;
I <a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>hope
it is now clear that Poet-Ape, who, like <i>Pantalabus</i>,
&ldquo;takes up all&rdquo;; who has &ldquo;grown to a little
wealth and credit in the scene,&rdquo; and who &ldquo;thinks
himself the chief&rdquo; of contemporary dramatists, can be
nobody but Shakespeare.&nbsp; Hence it follows that the
&ldquo;works&rdquo; of Poet-Ape, are the works of
Shakespeare.&nbsp; Ben admits, nay, asserts the existence of the
works, says that they may reach &ldquo;the after-time,&rdquo; but
he calls them a mass of plagiarisms,&mdash;because he is in a
jealous rage.</p>
<p>But this view does not at all suit Mr. Greenwood, for it shows
Ben regarding Shakespeare as the &ldquo;Ape,&rdquo; or Actor, and
also as the &ldquo;Poet&rdquo; and author of the
&ldquo;works.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet Ben&rsquo;s words mean nothing if
not that an actor is the author of works which Ben accuses of
plagiarism.&nbsp; Mr. Greenwood thinks that the epigram proves
merely that &ldquo;Jonson looked upon Shakspere (if, indeed, he
refers to him) as one who put forward the writings of others as
his own, or, in plain English, an impostor.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;The work which goes in his name is, in truth, the work of
somebody else.&rdquo; <a name="citation244a"></a><a
href="#footnote244a" class="citation">[244a]</a>&nbsp; Mr.
Greenwood put the same interpretation on Greene&rsquo;s words
about &ldquo;Shakescene,&rdquo; and we showed that the
interpretation was impossible.&nbsp; &ldquo;The utmost we should
be entitled to say&rdquo; (if Shake-scene be meant for Shakspere)
&ldquo;is that Greene accuses Player Shakspere of putting
forward, as his own, some work <a name="page245"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 245</span>or perhaps some parts of a work, for
which he was really indebted to another.&rdquo; <a
name="citation245a"></a><a href="#footnote245a"
class="citation">[245a]</a>&nbsp; We proved, by quoting
Greene&rsquo;s words, that he said nothing which could be
tortured into this sense. <a name="citation245b"></a><a
href="#footnote245b" class="citation">[245b]</a>&nbsp; In the
same way Ben&rsquo;s words cannot be tortured into the sense that
&ldquo;the work which goes in his&rdquo; (Poet-Ape&rsquo;s)
&ldquo;name is, in truth, the work of somebody else.&rdquo; <a
name="citation245c"></a><a href="#footnote245c"
class="citation">[245c]</a>&nbsp; Mr. Greenwood tries to find the
Anti-Willian hypothesis in Greene&rsquo;s <i>Groatsworth of
Wit</i> and in Ben&rsquo;s epigram.&nbsp; It is in neither.</p>
<p>Jonson is not accusing Shakespeare of pretending to be the
author of plays written by somebody else, but of &ldquo;making
<i>each man&rsquo;s</i> wit his own,&rdquo; and the <i>men</i>
are the other dramatists of the day.&nbsp; Thus the future
&ldquo;may judge&rdquo; Shakespeare&rsquo;s work &ldquo;to be his
as well as <i>ours</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is &ldquo;we,&rdquo; the living and recognised dramatists,
whom Shakespeare is said to plagiarise from; so boldly that</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>We</i>, <i>the robbed</i>, leave rage,
and pity it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ben does not mean that Shakespeare is publishing, as his own,
whole plays by some other author, but that his works are tissues
of scraps stolen from his contemporaries, from &ldquo;us, the
robbed.&rdquo;&nbsp; Where are to be found or heard of any works
by a player-poet of 1601, the would-be chief dramatist of the
day, except those signed <a name="page246"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 246</span>William Shak(&amp;c.).&nbsp; There
are none, and thus Ben, at this date, is identifying Will
Shakspere, the actor, with the author of the Shakespearean plays,
which he expects to reach posterity; &ldquo;after times may judge
them to be his,&rdquo; as after times do to this hour.</p>
<p>Thus Ben expresses, in accordance with his humour on each
occasion, most discrepant opinions of Will&rsquo;s works, but he
never varies from his identification of Will with the author of
the plays.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;works&rdquo; of which Ben wrote so splenetically in
<i>Poet-Ape</i>, were the works of a Playwright-Actor, who could
be nobody but the actor Shakespeare, as far as Ben then
knew.&nbsp; If later, and in altered circumstances, he wrote of
the very same works in very different terms, his
&ldquo;utterances&rdquo; are &ldquo;not easily
reconcilable&rdquo; with each other,&mdash;<i>whoever</i> the
real author of the works may be.&nbsp; If Bacon, or Mr.
Greenwood&rsquo;s anonymous equivalent for Bacon, were the
author, and if Ben came to know it, his attitudes towards the
<i>works</i> are still as irreconcilable as ever.</p>
<p>Perhaps Baconians and Mr. Greenwood might say, &ldquo;as long
as Ben believed that the works were those of an Actor-Playwright,
he thought them execrable.&nbsp; But when he learned that they
were the works of Bacon (or of some Great One), he declared them
to be more than excellent&rdquo;&mdash;<i>but not to
Drummond</i>.&nbsp; I am reluctant to think that Jonson was the
falsest and meanest of snobs.&nbsp; <a name="page247"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 247</span>I think that when his old rival, by
his own account his dear friend, was dead, and when (1623) Ben
was writing panegyric verses about the first collected edition of
his plays (the Folio), then between generosity and his habitual
hyperbolical manner when he was composing commendatory verses, he
said,&mdash;not too much in the way of praise,&mdash;but a good
deal more than he later said (1630?), in prose, and in cold
blood.&nbsp; I am only taking Ben as I find him and as I
understand him.&nbsp; Every step in my argument rests on
well-known facts.&nbsp; Ben notoriously, in his many panegyric
verses, wrote in a style of inflated praise.&nbsp; In
conversation with Drummond he censured, in brief blunt phrases,
the men whom, in verse, he had extolled.&nbsp; The Baconian who
has not read all Ben&rsquo;s panegyrics in verse, and the whole
of his conversations with Drummond, argues in ignorance.</p>
<p>We now come to Ben&rsquo;s panegyrics in the Folio of
1623.&nbsp; Ben heads the lines,</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<span
class="GutSmall">TO THE MEMORY OF MY BELOVED</span><br />
THE AUTHOR<br />
<span class="GutSmall">MR. WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">AND</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">WHAT HE HATH LEFT US.</span>&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Words cannot be more explicit.&nbsp; Bacon was alive (I do not
know when Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s hidden genius died), and Ben goes
on to speak of the <a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
248</span>Author, Shakespeare, as dead, and buried.&nbsp; He
calls on him thus:</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Soul of the Age!<br />
The applause! delight! the wonder of our Stage!<br />
My Shakespear rise: I will not lodge thee by<br />
Chaucer, or Spenser, or bid Beaumont lie<br />
A little further, to make thee a room:<br />
Thou art a monument, without a tomb,<br />
And art alive still, while thy book doth live,<br />
And we have wits to read, and praise to give.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beaumont, by the way, died in the same year as Shakespeare,
1616, and, while Ben here names him with Chaucer, Spenser, and
Shakespeare, his contemporaries have left no anecdotes, no
biographical hints.&nbsp; In the panegyric follow the lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And though thou hadst small Latin and less
Greek,<br />
From thence to honour thee I would not seek<br />
For names, but call forth thund&rsquo;ring
&AElig;schylus,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the other glories of the Roman and Attic stage, to see and
hear how Shakespeare bore comparison with all that the classic
dramatists did, or that &ldquo;did from their ashes
come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jonson means, &ldquo;despite your lack of Greek and Latin I
would not shrink from challenging the greatest Greek and Roman
tragedians to see how you bear comparison with
themselves&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood and the Baconians believe that the author of the
plays abounded in Latin and Greek.&nbsp; In my opinion his
classical scholarship must have seemed slight indeed to Ben, so
<a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>learned
and so vain of his learning: but this is part of a vexed
question, already examined.&nbsp; So far, Ben&rsquo;s verses have
brought not a hint to suggest that he does not identify the
actor, his Beloved, with the author.&nbsp; Nothing is gained when
Ben, in commendatory verses, praises &ldquo;Thy Art,&rdquo;
whereas, speaking to Drummond of Hawthornden (1619), he said that
Shakespeare &ldquo;wanted art.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ben is not now
growling to Drummond of Hawthornden: he is writing a panegyric,
and applauds Shakespeare&rsquo;s &ldquo;well-turned and
true-filed lines,&rdquo; adding that, &ldquo;to write a living
line&rdquo; a man &ldquo;must sweat,&rdquo; and &ldquo;strike the
second heat upon the Muses&rsquo; anvil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To produce such lines requires labour, requires conscious
&ldquo;art.&rdquo;&nbsp; So Shakespeare <i>had</i>
&ldquo;art,&rdquo; after all, despite what Ben had said to
Drummond: &ldquo;Shakespeare lacked art.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is no
more in the matter; the &ldquo;inconsistency&rdquo; is that of
Ben&rsquo;s humours on two perfectly different occasions, now
grumbling to Drummond; and now writing hyperbolically in
commendatory verses.&nbsp; But the contrast makes Mr. Greenwood
exclaim, &ldquo;Can anything be more astonishing and at the same
time more unsatisfactory than this?&rdquo; <a
name="citation249a"></a><a href="#footnote249a"
class="citation">[249a]</a></p>
<p>Can anything be more like Ben Jonson?</p>
<p>Did he know the secret of the authorship in 1619?&nbsp; If so,
why did he say nothing about the plays of the Great Unknown (whom
he called Shakespeare), save what Drummond reports, <a
name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>&ldquo;want
of art,&rdquo; ignorance of Bohemian geography.&nbsp; Or did Ben
<i>not</i> know the secret till, say, 1623, and then heap on the
very works which he had previously scouted praise for the very
quality which he had said they lacked?&nbsp; If so, Ben was as
absolutely inconsistent, as before.&nbsp; There is no way out of
this dilemma.&nbsp; On neither choice are Ben&rsquo;s utterances
&ldquo;easy to reconcile one with the other,&rdquo; except on the
ground that Ben was&mdash;Ben, and his comments varied with his
varying humours and occasions.&nbsp; I believe that, in the
commendatory verses, Ben allowed his Muse to carry him up to
heights of hyperbolical praise which he never came near in cold
blood.&nbsp; He was warmed with the heat of poetic composition
and wound up to heights of eulogy, though even <i>now</i> he
could not forget the small Latin and less Greek!</p>
<p>We now turn to Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s views about the
commendatory verses.&nbsp; On mature consideration I say nothing
of his remarks on Ben&rsquo;s couplets about the bad engraved
portrait. <a name="citation250a"></a><a href="#footnote250a"
class="citation">[250a]</a>&nbsp; They are concerned with the
supposed &ldquo;<i>original</i> bust,&rdquo; as represented in
Dugdale&rsquo;s engraving of 1656.&nbsp; What the Baconians hope
to make out of &ldquo;the <i>original</i> bust&rdquo; I am quite
unable to understand. <a name="citation250b"></a><a
href="#footnote250b" class="citation">[250b]</a>&nbsp; Again, I
leave untouched some witticisms <a name="citation250c"></a><a
href="#footnote250c" class="citation">[250c]</a> on
Jonson&rsquo;s lines about Spenser, Chaucer, and Beaumont in
their tombs&mdash;lines <a name="page251"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 251</span>either suggested by, or suggestive
of others by an uncertain W. Basse, &ldquo;but the evidence of
authorship seems somewhat doubtful.&nbsp; How the date is
determined I do not know . . . &rdquo; <a
name="citation251a"></a><a href="#footnote251a"
class="citation">[251a]</a>&nbsp; As Mr. Greenwood knows so
little, and as the discussion merely adds dust to the dust, and
fog to the mist of his attempt to disable Ben&rsquo;s evidence, I
glance and pass by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then follow these memorable words, which I have already
discussed:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And though thou hadst small Latin
and less Greek . . . &rsquo;&rdquo; <a name="citation251b"></a><a
href="#footnote251b" class="citation">[251b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In &ldquo;these memorable words,&rdquo; every non-Baconian
sees Ben&rsquo;s opinion about his friend&rsquo;s lack of
scholarship.&nbsp; According to his own excellent Index, Mr.
Greenwood has already adverted often to &ldquo;these memorable
words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(1)&nbsp; P. 40.&nbsp; &ldquo; . . . if this testimony is to
be explained away as not seriously written, then are we justified
in applying the same methods of interpretation to Jonson&rsquo;s
other utterances as published in the Folio of 1623.&nbsp; But I
shall have more to say as to that further on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(2)&nbsp; P. 88.&nbsp; Nothing of importance.</p>
<p>(3)&nbsp; P. 220.&nbsp; Quotation from Dr. Johnson.&nbsp; Ben,
&ldquo;who had no imaginable temptation to falsehood,&rdquo;
wrote the memorable words.&nbsp; But Mr. Greenwood has to imagine
a &ldquo;temptation to falsehood,&rdquo;&mdash;and he does.</p>
<p><a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
252</span>(4)&nbsp; P. 222.&nbsp; &ldquo;And we have recognised
that Jonson&rsquo;s &lsquo;small Latin and less Greek&rsquo; must
be explained away&rdquo; (a quotation from somebody).</p>
<p>(5)&nbsp; P. 225.&nbsp; Allusion to anecdote of &ldquo;Latin
(latten) spoons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>(6)&nbsp; Pp. 382, 383.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some of us&rdquo; (some
of whom?) &ldquo;have long looked upon it as axiomatic . . . that
Jonson&rsquo;s &lsquo;small Latin and less Greek,&rsquo; if meant
to be taken seriously, can only be applicable to Shakspere of
Stratford and not to Shakespeare,&rdquo; that is, not to the
Unknown author.&nbsp; Unluckily Ben, in 1623, is addressing the
shade of the &ldquo;sweet Swan of Avon,&rdquo; meaning
Stratford-on-Avon.</p>
<p>(7)&nbsp; The next references in the laudable Index are to pp.
474, 475.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then follow these memorable words, which I
have already discussed:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And though thou hadst small Latin
and less Greek,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>words which those who see how singularly inappropriate they
are to the author of the <i>Plays</i> and <i>Poems</i> of
Shakespeare have been at such infinite pains to explain away
without impeaching the credit of the author, or assuming that he
is here indulging in a little Socratic irony.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>I</i> do not want to &ldquo;explain&rdquo; Ben&rsquo;s
words &ldquo;away&rdquo;: I want to know how on earth Mr.
Greenwood explains them away.&nbsp; My view is that Ben meant
what he said, that Will, whose shade he is addressing, was no
scholar (which he assuredly was not).&nbsp; I diligently search
Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s <a name="page253"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 253</span>scriptures, asking How does he
explain Ben&rsquo;s &ldquo;memorable words&rdquo; away?&nbsp; On
p. 106 of <i>The Shakespeare Problem Restated</i> I seem to catch
a glimmer of his method.&nbsp; &ldquo;Once let the
Stratfordians&rdquo; (every human and non-Baconian person of
education) &ldquo;admit that Jonson when he penned the words
&lsquo;small Latin and less Greek&rsquo; was really writing
&lsquo;with his tongue in his cheek.&rsquo; . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>Once admit that vulgarism concerning a great English poet
engaged on a poem of Pindaric flight, and of prophetic
vision!&nbsp; No, we leave the admission to Mr. Greenwood and his
allies.</p>
<p>To consider thus is to consider too seriously.&nbsp; The
Baconians and Anti-Willians have ceased to deserve serious
attention (if ever they did deserve it), and virtuous
indignation, and all that kind of thing, when they ask people who
care for poetry to &ldquo;admit&rdquo; that Ben wrote his verses
&ldquo;with his tongue in his cheek.&rdquo;&nbsp; Elsewhere, <a
name="citation253a"></a><a href="#footnote253a"
class="citation">[253a]</a> in place of Ben&rsquo;s &ldquo;tongue
in his cheek,&rdquo; Mr. Greenwood prefers to suggest that Ben
&ldquo;is here indulging in a little Socratic irony.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Socrates &ldquo;with his tongue in his cheek&rdquo;!&nbsp; Say
&ldquo;talking through his throat,&rdquo; if one may accept the
evidence of the author of <i>Raffles</i>, as to the idioms of
burglars.</p>
<p>To return to criticism, we are to admit that Jonson was really
writing &ldquo;with his tongue in his cheek,&rdquo; knowing that,
as a fact, &ldquo;<i>Shakespeare</i>&rdquo; <a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>(the Great
Unknown, the Bacon of the Baconians) &ldquo;had remarkable
classical attainments, and they, of course, open the door to the
suggestion that the entire poem is capable of an ironical
construction and esoteric interpretation.&rdquo; <a
name="citation254a"></a><a href="#footnote254a"
class="citation">[254a]</a></p>
<p>So this is Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s method of &ldquo;explaining
away&rdquo; the memorable words.&nbsp; He seems to conjecture
that Will was not <i>Shakespeare</i>, not the author of the
plays; that Jonson knew it; that his poem is, as a whole,
addressed to Bacon, or to the Great Unknown, under his
&ldquo;<i>nom de plume</i>&rdquo; of &ldquo;William
Shakespeare&rdquo;; that the address to the &ldquo;Swan of
Avon&rdquo; is a mere blind; and that Ben only alludes to his
&ldquo;Beloved,&rdquo; the Stratford actor, when he tells his
Beloved that his Beloved has &ldquo;small Latin and less
Greek.&rdquo;&nbsp; All the praise is for Bacon, or the Great
Unknown (Mr. Harris), the jeer is for &ldquo;his Beloved, the
Author, Mr. William Shakespeare, And what he hath left
Us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As far as I presume to understand this theory of the
&ldquo;tongue in the cheek,&rdquo; of the &ldquo;Socratic
irony,&rdquo; this is what Mr. Greenwood has to propose towards
&ldquo;explaining away&rdquo; the evidence of Ben Jonson, in his
famous commendatory verses.&nbsp; When we can see through the
dust of words we find that the &ldquo;esoteric
interpretation&rdquo; of the commendatory verses is merely a
reassertion of the general theory: a man with small Latin and <a
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>less Greek
could not have written the plays and poems.&nbsp; Therefore when
Ben explicitly states that his Beloved, Mr. Shakespeare of
Stratford, the Swan of Avon <i>did</i> write the plays, and had
small Latin and less Greek, Ben meant that he did <i>not</i>
write them, that they were written by somebody else who had
plenty of Greek and Latin.&nbsp; It is a strange logical
method!&nbsp; Mr. Greenwood merely reasserts his paradox, and
proves it, like certain Biblical critics of more orthodoxy than
sense, by aid of his private &ldquo;esoteric method of
interpretation.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ben, we say, about 1630, in prose
and in cold blood, and in a humour of criticism without the old
rancour and envy, or the transitory poetic enthusiasm, pens a
note on Shakespeare in a volume styled &ldquo;Timber, or
Discoveries, made upon men and Matter, as they have flowed out of
his daily Readings; or had their reflux to his peculiar Notion of
the Times.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ben died in 1637; his MS. collection of
notes and brief essays, and reflections, was published in
1641.&nbsp; Bacon, of whom he wrote his impressions in this
manuscript, had died in 1626.&nbsp; Ben was no longer young: he
says, among these notes, that his memory, once unusually strong,
after he was past forty &ldquo;is much decayed in me . . .&nbsp;
It was wont to be faithful to me, but shaken with age now . .
.&rdquo;&nbsp; (I copy the extract as given by Mr. Greenwood. <a
name="citation255a"></a><a href="#footnote255a"
class="citation">[255a]</a>)&nbsp; He spoke sooth: he attributes
to Orpheus, in <a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
256</span>&ldquo;Timber,&rdquo; a line from Homer, and quotes
from Homer what is not in that poet&rsquo;s
&ldquo;works.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this manuscript occurs, then, a brief prose note, headed,
<i>De Shakespeare nostrati</i>, on our countryman
Shakespeare.&nbsp; It is an anecdote of the Players and their
ignorance, with a few critical and personal remarks on
Shakespeare.&nbsp; &ldquo;I remember the players have often
mentioned it as an honour to Shakespeare that (whatsoever he
penned) he never blotted out a line.&nbsp; My answer hath been,
&lsquo;Would he had blotted a thousand,&rsquo; which they thought
a malevolent speech.&nbsp; I had not told posterity this but for
their ignorance who chose that circumstance to commend their
friend by (that) wherein he most faulted; and to justify mine own
candour, for I loved the man, and do honour his memory on this
side idolatry as much as any.&nbsp; He was, indeed, honest, and
of an open and free nature; had an excellent phantasy, brave
notions and gentle expressions, wherein he flowed with that
facility that sometimes it was necessary he should be
stopped.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>Sufflaminandus erat</i>,&rsquo; as
Augustus said of Haterius.&nbsp; His wit was in his own power;
would the rule of it had been so too!&nbsp; Many times he fell
into those things could not escape laughter, as when he said in
the person of C&aelig;sar, one speaking to him,
&lsquo;C&aelig;sar, thou dost me wrong.&rsquo;&nbsp; He replied,
&lsquo;C&aelig;sar did never wrong but with just cause&rsquo;;
and such like, which were ridiculous.&nbsp; But he redeemed his
vices with his virtues.&nbsp; <a name="page257"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 257</span>There was ever more in him to be
praised than to be pardoned.&rdquo;&nbsp; Baconians actually
maintain that Ben is here speaking of Bacon.</p>
<p>Of whom is Ben writing?&nbsp; Of the author of <i>Julius
C&aelig;sar</i>,&mdash;certainly, from which, his memory failing,
he misquotes a line.&nbsp; If Ben be in the great
secret&mdash;that the author was Bacon, or Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s
Great Unknown, he is here no more enthusiastic about the Shadow
or the Statesman, than about Shakespeare; no less cool and
critical, whoever may be the subject of his comments.&nbsp;
Whether, in the commendatory verses, he referred to the
Actor-Author, or Bacon, or the Shining Shadow, or all of them at
once, he is now in a mood very much more cool and critical.&nbsp;
If to be so cool and critical is violently inconsistent in the
case of the Stratford actor, it is not less so if Ben has Bacon
or the Shadow in his mind.&nbsp; Meanwhile the person of whom he
speaks <i>is here the actor-author</i>, whom the players, his
friends, commended &ldquo;wherein he faulted,&rdquo; namely, in
not &ldquo;blotting&rdquo; where, in a thousand cases, Ben wishes
that he <i>had</i> blotted.&nbsp; Can the most enthusiastic
Baconian believe that when Ben wrote about the players&rsquo;
ignorant applause of Shakespeare&rsquo;s, of their friend&rsquo;s
lack of care in correction, Ben had Bacon in his mind?</p>
<p>As for Mr. Greenwood, he says that in Ben&rsquo;s sentence
about the players and their ignorant commendation, &ldquo;we have
it on Jonson&rsquo;s testimony that the players looked upon
William <a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
258</span>Shakspere the actor as the author of the plays and
praised him for never blotting out a line.&rdquo;&nbsp; We have
it, and how is the critic to get over or round the fact?&nbsp;
Thus, &ldquo;We know that this statement&rdquo; (about the almost
blotless lines) &ldquo;is ridiculous; that if the players had any
unblotted manuscripts in their hands (which is by no means
probable) they were merely fair copies . . . &rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps, but the Baconians appear to assume that a &ldquo;fair
copy&rdquo; is not, and cannot be, a copy in the handwriting of
the author.</p>
<p>As I have said before, the Players knew Will&rsquo;s
handwriting, if he could write.&nbsp; If they received his copy
in a hand not his own, and were not idiots, they could not praise
him and his unerring speed and accuracy in penning his
thoughts.&nbsp; If, on the other hand, Will could not write, in
their long friendship with Will, the Players must have known the
fact, and could not possibly believe, as they certainly did,
&ldquo;on Jonson&rsquo;s testimony&rdquo; in his authorship.</p>
<p>To finish Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s observations, &ldquo;if
they&rdquo; (the players) &ldquo;really thought that the author
of the plays wrote them off <i>currente calamo</i>, and
never&rdquo; (or &ldquo;hardly ever&rdquo;) &ldquo;blotted a
line, never revised, never made any alterations, they knew
nothing whatever concerning the real Shakespeare.&rdquo; <a
name="citation258a"></a><a href="#footnote258a"
class="citation">[258a]</a></p>
<p>Nothing whatever?&nbsp; What they did not know was merely that
Will gave them fair copies in his <a name="page259"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 259</span>own hand, as, before the typewriting
machine was invented, authors were wont to do.&nbsp; Within the
last fortnight I heard the error attributed to the players made
by an English scholar who is foremost in his own field of
learning.&nbsp; He and I were looking at some of Dickens&rsquo;s
MSS.&nbsp; They were full of erasions and corrections.&nbsp; I
said, &ldquo;How unlike Scott!&rdquo; whose first draft of his
novels exactly answered to the players&rsquo; description of
Will&rsquo;s &ldquo;copy.&rdquo;&nbsp; My friend said,
&ldquo;Browning scarcely made an erasion or change in writing his
poems,&rdquo; and referred to Mr. Browning&rsquo;s MSS. for the
press, of which examples were lying near us.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
Browning must have made clean copies for the press,&rdquo; I
said: which was as new an idea to my learned friend as it was
undreamed of by the Players:&mdash;if what they received from him
were his clean copies.</p>
<p>The Players&rsquo; testimony, through Jonson, cannot be
destroyed by the &ldquo;easy stratagem&rdquo; of Mr.
Greenwood.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood now nearly falls back on Bacon, though he
constantly professes that he &ldquo;is not the advocate of
Bacon&rsquo;s authorship.&rdquo;&nbsp; The author was some great
man, as like Bacon as one pea to another.&nbsp; Mr. Greenwood
says that Jonson looked on the issue of the First Folio <a
name="citation259a"></a><a href="#footnote259a"
class="citation">[259a]</a> &ldquo;as a very special
occasion.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, it <i>was</i> a very special
occasion; no literary occasion could be more
&ldquo;special.&rdquo;&nbsp; Without the Folio, badly as it is <a
name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>executed,
we should perhaps never have had many of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
plays.&nbsp; The occasion was special in the highest degree.</p>
<p>But, says Mr. Greenwood, &ldquo;if we could only get to the
back of Jonson&rsquo;s mind, we should find that there was some
efficient cause operating to induce him to give the best possible
send-off to that celebrated venture.&rdquo; <a
name="citation260a"></a><a href="#footnote260a"
class="citation">[260a]</a></p>
<p>Ben was much in the habit of giving &ldquo;sendoffs&rdquo; of
great eloquence to poetic &ldquo;ventures&rdquo; now
forgotten.&nbsp; What could &ldquo;the efficient cause&rdquo; be
in the case of the Folio?&nbsp; At once Mr. Greenwood has
recourse to Bacon; he cannot, do what he will, keep Bacon
&ldquo;out of the Memorial.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ben was with Bacon at
Gorhambury, on Bacon&rsquo;s sixtieth birthday (January 22,
1621).&nbsp; Ben wrote verses about the Genius of the old
house,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thou stand&rsquo;st as if some mystery thou
didst.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What was that &lsquo;mystery&rsquo;?&rdquo; asks Mr.
Greenwood. <a name="citation260b"></a><a href="#footnote260b"
class="citation">[260b]</a>&nbsp; What indeed?&nbsp; And what has
all this to do with Ben&rsquo;s commendatory verses for the
Folio, two years later?&nbsp; Mr. Greenwood also surmises, as we
have seen, <a name="citation260c"></a><a href="#footnote260c"
class="citation">[260c]</a> that Jonson was with Bacon, helping
to translate <i>The Advancement of Learning</i> in June,
1623.</p>
<p>Let us suppose that he was: what has that to do with
Ben&rsquo;s verses for the Folio?&nbsp; Does Mr. <a
name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>Greenwood
mean to hint that <i>Bacon</i> was the &ldquo;efficient cause
operating to induce&rdquo; Ben &ldquo;to give the best possible
send-off&rdquo; to the Folio?&nbsp; One does not see what
interest Bacon had in stimulating the enthusiasm of Ben, unless
we accept Bacon as author of the plays, which Mr. Greenwood does
not.&nbsp; If Mr. Greenwood thinks that Bacon was the author of
the plays, then the facts are suitable to his belief.&nbsp; But
if he does not,&mdash;&ldquo;I hold no brief for the
Baconians,&rdquo; he says,&mdash;how is all this passage on
Ben&rsquo;s visits to Bacon concerned with the subject in
hand?</p>
<p>Between the passage on some &ldquo;efficient cause&rdquo;
&ldquo;at the back of Ben&rsquo;s mind,&rdquo; <a

class="citation">[261a]</a> and the passage on Ben&rsquo;s visits
to Bacon in 1621&ndash;3, <a name="citation261b"></a><a
href="#footnote261b" class="citation">[261b]</a> six pages
intervene, and blur the supposed connection between the
&ldquo;efficient cause&rdquo; of Ben&rsquo;s verses of 1623, and
his visits to Bacon in 1621&ndash;3.&nbsp; These intercalary
pages are concerned with Ben&rsquo;s laudations of Bacon, by
name, in his <i>Discoveries</i>.&nbsp; The first is entirely
confined to praise of Bacon as an orator.&nbsp; Bacon is next
mentioned in a Catalogue of Writers as &ldquo;<i>he who hath
filled up all numbers</i>, and performed that in our tongue which
may be preferred or compared either to <i>insolent Greece or
haughty Rome</i>,&rdquo; words used of Shakespeare by Jonson in
the Folio verses.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood remarks that Jonson&rsquo;s Catalogue, to judge
by the names he cites (More, <a name="page262"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 262</span>Chaloner, Smith, Sir Nicholas Bacon,
Sidney, Hooker, Essex, Raleigh, Savile, Sandys, and so on),
suggests that &ldquo;he is thinking mainly of wits and orators of
his own and the preceding generation,&rdquo; not of poets
specially.&nbsp; This is obvious; why should Ben name Shakespeare
with More, Smith, Chaloner, Eliot, Bishop Gardiner, Egerton,
Sandys, and Savile?&nbsp; Yet &ldquo;it is remarkable that no
mention should be made of the great dramatist.&rdquo;&nbsp; Where
is Spenser named, or Beaumont, or Chaucer, with whom Ben ranked
Shakespeare?&nbsp; Ben quoted of Bacon the line he wrote long
before of Shakespeare as a poet, about &ldquo;insolent
Greece,&rdquo; and all this is &ldquo;remarkable,&rdquo; and Mr.
Greenwood finds it &ldquo;not surprising&rdquo; <a
name="citation262a"></a><a href="#footnote262a"
class="citation">[262a]</a> that the Baconians dwell on the
&ldquo;extraordinary coincidence of expression,&rdquo; as if Ben
were incapable of repeating a happy phrase from himself, and as
if we should wonder at anything the Baconians may say or do.</p>
<p>Another startling coincidence is that, in <i>Discoveries</i>,
Ben said of Shakespeare &ldquo;his wit was in his own
power,&rdquo; and wished that &ldquo;the rule of it had been so
too.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of Bacon, Ben wrote, &ldquo;his language, where
he could spare or pass by a jest, was nobly
censorious.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus Bacon <i>had</i> &ldquo;the rule of
his own wit,&rdquo; Bacon &ldquo;<i>could</i> spare or pass by a
jest,&rdquo; whereas Shakespeare apparently could not&mdash;so
like were the two Dromios in this particular!&nbsp; Strong in
these convincing arguments, <a name="page263"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 263</span>the Baconians ask (not so Mr.
Greenwood, he is no Baconian), &ldquo;were there then <i>two</i>
writers of whom this description was appropriate . . .
?&rdquo;&nbsp; Was there only one, and was it of Bacon, under the
name of &ldquo;Shakespeare,&rdquo; that Ben wrote <i>De
Shakespeare nostrati</i>?</p>
<p>Read it again, substituting &ldquo;Bacon&rdquo; for
&ldquo;Shakespeare.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I remember the
players,&rdquo; and so on, and what has Bacon to do here?&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sometimes it was necessary that <i>Bacon</i> should be
stopped.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Many times <i>Bacon</i> fell into
those things could not escape laughter,&rdquo; such as
C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s supposed line, &ldquo;and such like, which
were ridiculous.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>Bacon</i> redeemed his
vices with his virtues.&nbsp; There was ever more in <i>Bacon</i>
to be praised than to be pardoned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus freely, according to the Baconians, speaks Ben of Bacon,
whom he here styles &ldquo;Shakespeare,&rdquo;&mdash;Heaven knows
why! while crediting him with the players as his friends.&nbsp;
Ben could not think or speak thus of Bacon.&nbsp; Mr. Greenwood
occupies his space with these sagacities of the Baconians; one
marvels why he takes the trouble.&nbsp; We are asked why Ben
wrote so little and that so cool (&ldquo;I loved him on this side
idolatry as much as any&rdquo;) about Shakespeare.&nbsp; Read
through Ben&rsquo;s <i>Discoveries</i>: what has he to say about
any one of his great contemporary dramatists, from Marlowe to
Beaumont?&nbsp; He says nothing about any of them; though he had
panegyrised them, as he panegyrised Beaumont, in verse.&nbsp; In
his <a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>prose <i>Discoveries</i> he speaks, among English
dramatists, of Shakespeare alone.</p>
<p>We are also asked by the Baconians to believe that his remarks
on Bacon under the name of Shakespeare are really an addition to
his more copious and infinitely more reverential observations on
Bacon, named by his own name; &ldquo;I have and do reverence him
for the greatness that was only proper to himself.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Also (where Bacon is spoken of as Shakespeare) &ldquo;He redeemed
his vices by his virtues.&nbsp; There was ever more in him to be
praised than to be pardoned . . . Sometimes it was necessary that
he should be stopped . . . Many times he fell into those things
that could not escape laughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These two views of Bacon are, if you like, incongruous.&nbsp;
The person spoken of is in both cases Bacon, say the Baconians,
and Mr. Greenwood sympathetically alludes to their ideas, <a
name="citation264a"></a><a href="#footnote264a"
class="citation">[264a]</a> which I cannot qualify in courteous
terms.&nbsp; Baconians &ldquo;would, of course, explain the
difficulty by saying that however sphinx-like were Jonson&rsquo;s
utterances, he had clearly distinct in his own mind two different
personages, viz. Shakspere the player, and Shakespeare the real
author of the plays and poems, and that if in the perplexing
passage quoted from the <i>Discoveries</i> he appears to confound
one with the other, it is because the solemn seal of secrecy had
been imposed on him.&rdquo;&nbsp; They <i>would</i> say, they
<i>do</i> say <a name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
265</span>all that.&nbsp; Ben is not to let out that Bacon is the
author.&nbsp; So he tells us of Bacon that he often made himself
ridiculous, and so forth,&mdash;but he <i>pretends</i> that he is
speaking of Shakespeare.</p>
<p>All this wedge of wisdom, remember, is inserted between the
search for &ldquo;the efficient cause&rdquo; of Ben&rsquo;s
panegyric (1623), in the Folio, on his Beloved Mr. William
Shakespeare, and the discovery of Ben&rsquo;s visits to Bacon in
1621&ndash;3.</p>
<p>Does Mr. Greenwood mean that Ben, in 1623 (or earlier), knew
the secret of Bacon&rsquo;s authorship, and, stimulated by his
hospitality, applauded his works in the Folio, while, as he must
not disclose the secret, he throughout speaks of Bacon as
Shakespeare, puns on that name in the line about seeming
&ldquo;to shake a lance,&rdquo; and salutes the Lord of
Gorhambury as &ldquo;Sweet Swan of Avon&rdquo;?&nbsp; Mr.
Greenwood cannot mean that; for he is not a Baconian.&nbsp; What
<i>does</i> he mean?</p>
<p>Put together his pages 483, 489&ndash;491.&nbsp; On the former
we find how &ldquo;it would appear&rdquo; that Jonson thought the
issue of the Folio (1623) &ldquo;a very special occasion,&rdquo;
and that perhaps if we could only &ldquo;get to the back of his
mind, we should find that there was some efficient cause
operating to induce him to give the best possible send-off to
that celebrated venture.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then skip to pp.
489&ndash;491, and you find very special occasions: Bacon&rsquo;s
birthday feast with its &ldquo;mystery&rdquo;; Ben as one of
Bacon&rsquo;s &ldquo;good pens,&rdquo; in 1623.&nbsp; <a
name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>&ldquo;The
best of these good pens, it seems, was Jonson.&rdquo; <a
name="citation266a"></a><a href="#footnote266a"
class="citation">[266a]</a>&nbsp; On what evidence does it
&ldquo;seem&rdquo;?&nbsp; The opinion of Judge Webb.</p>
<p>Is this supposed collaboration with Bacon in 1623, &ldquo;the
efficient cause operating to induce&rdquo; Ben &ldquo;to give the
best possible send-off&rdquo; to the Folio?&nbsp; How could this
be the &ldquo;efficient cause&rdquo; if Bacon were not the author
of the plays?</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood, like the Genius at the birthday supper,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Stands as if some mystery he
did.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On a trifling point of honour, namely, as to whether Ben were
a man likely to lie, tortuously, hypocritically, to be
elaborately false about the authorship of the Shakespearean
plays, it is hopelessly impossible to bring the Baconians and Mr.
Greenwood (who &ldquo;holds no brief for the Baconians&rdquo;) to
my point of view.&nbsp; Mr. Greenwood rides off thus&mdash;what
the Baconians do is unimportant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are, as everybody knows, many falsehoods that are
justifiable, some that it is actually a duty to
tell.&rdquo;&nbsp; It may be so; I pray that I may never tell any
of them (or any more of them).</p>
<p>Among justifiable lies I do not reckon that of Scott if ever
he plumply denied that he wrote the <i>Waverley</i> novels.&nbsp;
I do not judge Sir Walter.&nbsp; Heaven forbid!&nbsp; But if, in
Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s words, he, &ldquo;we are told, thought it
perfectly justifiable for a writer who wished to preserve <a
name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>his
anonymity, to deny, when questioned, the authorship of a work,
since the interrogator had no right to put such a question to
him,&rdquo; <a name="citation267a"></a><a href="#footnote267a"
class="citation">[267a]</a> I disagree with Sir Walter.&nbsp;
Many other measures, in accordance with the conditions of each
case, were open to him.&nbsp; Some are formulated by his own
Bucklaw, in <i>The Bride of Lammermoor</i>, as regards questions
about what occurred on his bridal night.&nbsp; Bucklaw would
challenge the man, and cut the lady, who asked questions.&nbsp;
But Scott&rsquo;s case, as cited, applies only to Bacon (or Mr.
Greenwood&rsquo;s Unknown), if <i>he</i> were asked whether or
not he were the author of the plays.&nbsp; No idiot, at that
date, was likely to put the question!&nbsp; But, if anyone did
ask, Bacon must either evade, or deny, or tell the truth.</p>
<p>On the parallel of Scott, Bacon could thus deny, evade, or
tell the truth.&nbsp; But the parallel of Scott is not applicable
to any other person except to the author who wishes to preserve
his anonymity, and is questioned.&nbsp; The parallel does not
apply to Ben.&nbsp; <i>He</i> had not written the Shakespearean
plays.&nbsp; Nobody was asking <i>him</i> if he had written
them.&nbsp; If he knew that the author was Bacon, and knew it
under pledge of secrecy, and was asked (<i>per impossibile</i>)
&ldquo;Who wrote these plays?&rdquo; he had only to say,
&ldquo;Look at the title-page.&rdquo;&nbsp; But no mortal was
asking Ben the question.&nbsp; But we are to suppose that, in the
panegyric and in <i>Discoveries</i>, Ben chooses to assert,
first, that <a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
268</span>Shakespeare was his Beloved, his Sweet Swan of Avon;
and that he &ldquo;loved him, on this side idolatry, as much as
any.&rdquo;&nbsp; There is no evidence that he did love
Shakespeare, except his own statement, when, according to the
Baconians, he is really speaking of Bacon, and, according to Mr.
Greenwood, of an unknown person, singularly like Bacon.&nbsp;
Consequently, unless we can prove that Ben really loved the
actor, he is telling a disgustingly hypocritical and wholly
needless falsehood, both before and after the death of
Bacon.&nbsp; To be silent about the authorship of a book, an
authorship which is the secret of your friend and patron, is one
thing and a blameless thing.&nbsp; All the friends, some twenty,
to whom Scott confided the secret of his authorship were
silent.&nbsp; But not one of them publicly averred that the
author was their very dear friend, So-and-so, who was not Scott,
and perhaps not their friend at all.&nbsp; That was Ben&rsquo;s
line.&nbsp; Thus the parallel with Scott drawn by Mr. Greenwood,
twice, <a name="citation268a"></a><a href="#footnote268a"
class="citation">[268a]</a> is no parallel.&nbsp; It has no kind
of analogy with Ben&rsquo;s alleged falsehoods, so elaborate, so
incomprehensible except by Baconians, and, if he did not love the
actor Shakspere dearly, so detestably hypocritical, and open to
instant detection.</p>
<p>It is not easy to find a parallel to the conduct with which
Ben is charged.&nbsp; But suppose that Scott lived unsuspected of
writing his novels, <a name="page269"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 269</span>which, let us say, he signed
&ldquo;James Hogg,&rdquo; and died without confessing his secret,
and without taking his elaborate precautions for its preservation
on record.</p>
<p>Next, imagine that Lockhart knew Scott&rsquo;s secret, under
vow of silence, and was determined to keep it at any cost.&nbsp;
He therefore, writing after the death of Hogg of Ettrick, and in
Scott&rsquo;s lifetime, publishes verses declaring that Hogg was
his &ldquo;beloved&rdquo; (an enormous fib), and that Hogg,
&ldquo;Sweet Swan of Ettrick,&rdquo; was the author of the
<i>Waverley</i> novels.</p>
<p>To complete the parallels, Lockhart, after Scott&rsquo;s
death, leaves a note in prose to the effect that, while he loved
Hogg on this side idolatry (again, a monstrous fable), he must
confess that Hogg, author of the <i>Waverley</i> novels, often
fell into things that were ridiculous; and often needed to have a
stopper put on him for all these remarks.&nbsp; Lockhart, while
speaking of Hogg, is thinking of Scott&mdash;and he makes the
remarks solely to conceal Scott&rsquo;s authorship of the
novels&mdash;of which, on the hypothesis, nobody suspected Scott
to be the author.&nbsp; Lockhart must then have been what the
Baconian Mr. Theobald calls Mr. Churton Collins, &ldquo;a
measureless liar,&rdquo;&mdash;all for no reason.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood, starting as usual from the case, which is no
parallel, of Scott&rsquo;s denying his own authorship, goes on,
&ldquo;for all we know, Jonson might have seen nothing in the
least objectionable <a name="page270"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 270</span>in the publication by some great
personage of his dramatic works under a pseudonym&rdquo; (under
another man&rsquo;s name really), &ldquo;even though that
pseudonym led to a wrong conception as to the authorship; and
that, if, being a friend of that great personage, and working in
his service&rdquo; (Ben worked, by the theory, in Bacon&rsquo;s),
&ldquo;he had solemnly engaged to preserve the secret inviolate,
and not to reveal it even to posterity, then <i>doubtless</i>
(&lsquo;I thank thee, Jew&rsquo; (meaning Sir Sidney Lee),
&lsquo;for teaching me that word&rsquo;!) he would have remained
true to that solemn pledge.&rdquo; <a name="citation270a"></a><a
href="#footnote270a" class="citation">[270a]</a></p>
<p>To remain &ldquo;true,&rdquo; Ben had only to hold his
peace.&nbsp; But he lied up and down, and right and left, and
even declared that Bacon was a friend of the players, and needed
to be shut up, and made himself a laughing-stock in his
plays,&mdash;styling Bacon &ldquo;Shakespeare.&rdquo;&nbsp; All
this, and much more of the same sort, we must steadfastly believe
before we can be Baconians, for only by believing these doctrines
can we get rid of Ben Jonson&rsquo;s testimony to the authorship
of Will Shakspere, Gent.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE PREOCCUPATIONS OF BACON</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Let</span> us now examine a miracle and
mystery in which the Baconians find nothing strange; nothing that
is not perfectly normal.&nbsp; Bacon was the author of the
Shakespearean plays, they tell us.&nbsp; Let us look rapidly at
his biography, after which we may ask, does not his poetic
supremacy, and imaginative fertility, border on the miraculous,
when we consider his occupations and his ruling passion?</p>
<p>Bacon, born in 1561, had a prodigious genius, was well aware
of it, and had his own ideal as to the task which he was born to
do.&nbsp; While still at Cambridge, and therefore before he was
fifteen, he was utterly dissatisfied, as he himself informed Dr.
Rawley, with the scientific doctrines of the Schools.&nbsp; In
the study of nature they reasoned from certain accepted ideas,
<i>a priori</i> principles, not from what he came to call
&ldquo;interrogation of Nature.&rdquo;&nbsp; There were, indeed,
and had long been experimental philosophers, but the school
doctors went not beyond Aristotle; and discovered nothing.&nbsp;
As Mr. Spedding puts it, the boy Bacon asked himself, &ldquo;If
our study of nature be thus barren, our method of study must be
wrong; <a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
274</span>might not a better method be found? . . .&nbsp; Upon
the conviction &lsquo;This may be done,&rsquo; followed at once
the question, <i>How</i> may it be done?&nbsp; Upon that question
answered followed the resolution to try and do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was, in religious phrase, the Conversion of Bacon,
&ldquo;the event which had a greater influence than any other
upon his character and future course.&nbsp; From that moment he
had a vocation which employed and stimulated him . . . an object
to live for as wide as humanity, as immortal as the human race;
an idea to live in vast and lofty enough to fill the soul for
ever with religious and heroic aspirations.&rdquo; <a
name="citation274a"></a><a href="#footnote274a"
class="citation">[274a]</a>&nbsp; The vocation, the idea, the
object, were not poetical.</p>
<p>In addition to this ceaseless scientific preoccupation, Bacon
was much concerned with the cause of reformed religion (then at
stake in France, and supposed to be in danger at home), and with
the good government of his native country.&nbsp; He could only
aid that cause by the favour of Elizabeth and James; by his
services in Parliament, where, despite his desire for
advancement, he conscientiously opposed the Queen.&nbsp; He was
obliged to work at such tasks of various sorts, legal and
polemical literature, as were set him by people in power.&nbsp;
With these three great objects filling his heart, inspiring his
ambition, and occupying his energies and time, we cannot <a
name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>easily
believe, without direct external evidence, that he, or any
mortal, could have leisure and detachment from his main objects
(to which we may add his own advancement) sufficient to enable
him to compose the works ascribed to Shakespeare.</p>
<p>Thus, at the age of twenty-two (1583), when, if ever, he might
have penned sonnets to his mistress&rsquo;s eyebrow, he reports
that he wrote &ldquo;his first essay on the Instauration of
Philosophy, which he called <i>Temporis Partus Maximus</i>,
&lsquo;The Greatest Birth of Time,&rsquo;&rdquo; and &ldquo;we
need not doubt that between Law and Philosophy he found enough to
do.&rdquo; <a name="citation275a"></a><a href="#footnote275a"
class="citation">[275a]</a>&nbsp; For the Baconians take Bacon to
have been a very great lawyer (of which I am no judge), and Law
is a hard mistress, rapacious of a man&rsquo;s hours.&nbsp; In
1584 he entered Parliament, but we do not hear anything very
important of his occupations before 1589, when he wrote a long
pamphlet, &ldquo;Touching the Controversies of the Church of
England.&rdquo; <a name="citation275b"></a><a
href="#footnote275b" class="citation">[275b]</a>&nbsp; He had
then leisure enough; that he was not anonymously supplying the
stage with plays I can neither prove nor disprove: but there is
no proof that he wrote <i>Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s
Lost</i>!&nbsp; By 1591&ndash;2, we learn much of him from his
letter to Cecil, who never would give him a place wherein he
could meditate his philosophy.&nbsp; He was apparently hard at
scientific work.&nbsp; &ldquo;I account my ordinary course of
study <a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
276</span>and meditation to be more painful than most parts of
action are.&rdquo;&nbsp; He adds, &ldquo;The contemplative planet
carries me away wholly,&rdquo; and by contemplation I conceive
him to mean what he calls &ldquo;vast contemplative
ends.&rdquo;&nbsp; These he proceeds to describe: he does
<i>not</i> mean the writing of <i>Venus and Adonis</i> (1593),
nor of <i>Lucrece</i> (1594), nor of comedies!&nbsp; &ldquo;I
have taken all knowledge to be my province,&rdquo; and he recurs
to his protest against the pseudo-science of his period.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If I could purge knowledge of two sorts of rovers whereof
the one, with frivolous disputations, confutations, and
verbosities; the other with blind experiments, and auricular
traditions and impostures, hath committed so many spoils, I hope
I should bring in industrious observations, grounded conclusions,
and profitable inventions and discoveries . . . This, whether it
be curiosity, or vainglory, or nature, or (if one take it
favourably) philanthropy, is so fixed in my mind that it cannot
be removed.&rdquo;&nbsp; If Cecil cannot help him to a post, if
he cannot serve the truth, he will reduce himself, like
Anaxagoras, to voluntary poverty, &ldquo; . . . and become some
sorry bookmaker, or a true pioneer in that mine of truth . . .
&rdquo; <a name="citation276a"></a><a href="#footnote276a"
class="citation">[276a]</a>&nbsp; Really, from first to last he
was the prince of begging-letter writers, endlessly asking for
place, pensions, reversions, money, and more money.</p>
<p>Though his years were thirty-one, Bacon was as <a
name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span>young at
heart as Shelley at eighteen, when he wrote thus to Cecil,
&ldquo;my Lord Treasurer Burghley.&rdquo;&nbsp; What did Cecil
care for his youngish kinsman&rsquo;s philanthropy, and
&ldquo;vast speculative ends&rdquo; (how <i>modern</i> it all
is!), and the rest of it?&nbsp; But just because Bacon, at
thirty-one, <i>is</i> so extremely &ldquo;green,&rdquo; going to
&ldquo;take all knowledge for his province&rdquo; (if some one
will only subsidise him, and endow his research), I conceive that
he was in earnest about his reformation of science.&nbsp; Surely
no Baconian will deny it!&nbsp; Being so deeply in earnest,
taking his &ldquo;study and meditation&rdquo; so hard, I cannot
see him as the author of <i>Venus and Adonis</i>, and whatever
plays of the period,&mdash;say, <i>Love&rsquo;s Labour&rsquo;s
Lost</i>, <i>The Two Gentlemen of Verona</i>, <i>Henry VI</i>,
Part I,&mdash;are attributed to him, about this time, by
Baconians.&nbsp; Of course my view is merely personal or
&ldquo;subjective.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Baconians&rsquo; view is also
&ldquo;subjective.&rdquo;&nbsp; I regard Bacon, in 1591, and
later, as intellectually preoccupied by his vast speculative
aims:&mdash;what he says that he desires to do, in science, is
what he <i>did</i>, as far as he was able.&nbsp; His other
desires, his personal advancement, money, a share in the conduct
of affairs, he also hotly pursued, not much to his own or the
public profit.&nbsp; There seems to be no room left, no
inclination left, for competition in their own line with Marlowe,
Greene, Nash, and half a dozen other professed playwrights: no
room for plays done under the absurd pseudonym of an ignorant
actor.</p>
<p><a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>You
see these things as the Baconians do, or as I do.&nbsp; Argument
is unavailing.&nbsp; I take Bacon to have been sincere in his
effusive letter to Cecil.&nbsp; Not so the Baconians; he
concealed, they think, a vast <i>literary</i> aim.&nbsp; They
must take his alternative&mdash;to be &ldquo;some sorry
bookmaker, <i>or</i> a pioneer in that mine of truth,&rdquo; as
meaning that he would either be the literary hack of a company of
players, <i>or</i> the founder of a regenerating
philosophy.&nbsp; But, at that date, playwrights could not well
be called &ldquo;bookmakers,&rdquo; for the owners of the plays
did their best to keep them from appearing as printed
books.&nbsp; If Bacon by &ldquo;bookmaker&rdquo; meant
&ldquo;playwright,&rdquo; he put a modest value on his poetical
work!</p>
<p>Meanwhile (1591&ndash;2), Bacon attached himself to the young,
beautiful, and famous Essex, on the way to be a Favourite, and
gave him much excellent advice, as he always did, and, as always,
his advice was not taken.&nbsp; It is not a novel suggestion,
that Essex is the young man to whom Bacon is so passionately
attached in the Sonnets traditionally attributed to
Shakespeare.&nbsp; &ldquo;I applied myself to him&rdquo; (that
is, to Essex), says Bacon, &ldquo;in a manner which, I think,
happeneth rarely among men.&rdquo;&nbsp; The poet of the Sonnets
applies himself to the Beloved Youth, in a manner which (luckily)
&ldquo;happeneth rarely among men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is difficult to fit the Sonnets into Bacon&rsquo;s
life.&nbsp; But, if you pursue the context of what Bacon says
concerning Essex, you find that he <a name="page279"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 279</span>does not speak <i>openly</i> of a
tenderly passionate attachment to that young man; not more than
<i>this</i>, &ldquo;I did nothing but advise and ruminate with
myself, to the best of my understanding, propositions and
memorials of anything that might concern his Lordship&rsquo;s
honour, fortune, or service.&rdquo; <a name="citation279a"></a><a
href="#footnote279a" class="citation">[279a]</a>&nbsp; As Bacon
did nothing but these things (1591&ndash;2), he had no great
leisure for writing poetry and plays.&nbsp; Moreover, speaking as
a poet, in the Sonnets, he might poetically exaggerate his
intense amatory devotion to Essex into the symbolism of his
passionate verse.&nbsp; <i>Was Essex then a married
man</i>?&nbsp; If so, the Sonneteer&rsquo;s insistence on his
marrying must be symbolical of&mdash;anything else you
please.</p>
<p>We know that Bacon, at this period, &ldquo;did nothing&rdquo;
but &ldquo;ruminate&rdquo; about Essex.&nbsp; The words are his
own! (1604).&nbsp; No plays, no <i>Venus and Adonis</i>, nothing
but enthusiastic service of Essex and the Sonnets.&nbsp; Mr.
Spedding, indeed, thinks that, to adorn some pageant of Essex
(November 17, 1592), Bacon kindly contributed such matter as
&ldquo;Mr. Bacon in Praise of Knowledge&rdquo; (containing his
usual views about regenerating science), and &ldquo;Mr.
Bacon&rsquo;s Discourse in Praise of his Sovereign.&rdquo; <a
name="citation279b"></a><a href="#footnote279b"
class="citation">[279b]</a>&nbsp; Both are excellent, though, for
a Court festival, not very gay.</p>
<p>He also, very early in 1593, wrote an answer <a
name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>to Father
Parson&rsquo;s (?) famous indictment of Elizabeth&rsquo;s
Government, in <i>Observations on a Libel</i>. <a
name="citation280a"></a><a href="#footnote280a"
class="citation">[280a]</a>&nbsp; What with ruminating on Essex,
and this essay, he was not solely devoted to <i>Venus and
Adonis</i> and to furbishing-up old plays, though, no doubt, he
<i>may</i> have unpacked his bosom in the Sonnets, and indulged
his luscious imaginations in <i>Venus and Adonis</i>.&nbsp; I
would not limit the potentialities of his genius.&nbsp; But,
certainly, this amazing man was busy in quite other matters than
poetry; not to mention his severe &ldquo;study and
meditation&rdquo; on science.</p>
<p>All these activities of Bacon, in the year of <i>Venus and
Adonis</i>, do not exhaust his exercises.&nbsp; Bacon, living
laborious days, plunged into the debate in the Commons on Supply
and fell into Elizabeth&rsquo;s disgrace, and vainly competed
with Coke for the Attorney-Generalship, and went on to write a
pamphlet on the conspiracy of Lopez, and to try to gain the
office of Solicitor-General, to manage Essex&rsquo;s affairs, to
plead at the Bar, to do Crown work as a lawyer, to urge his suit
for the Solicitorship; to trifle with the composition of
&ldquo;Formularies and Elegancies&rdquo; (January 1595), to write
his Essays, to try for the Mastership of the Rolls, to struggle
with the affairs of the doomed Essex (1600&ndash;1), while always
&ldquo;labouring in secret&rdquo; at that vast aim of the
reorganisation of natural science, which ever preoccupied him, <a
name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 281</span>he says,
and distracted his attention from his practice and from affairs
of State. <a name="citation281a"></a><a href="#footnote281a"
class="citation">[281a]</a>&nbsp; Of these State affairs the
projected Union with Scotland was the most onerous.&nbsp; He was
also writing <i>The Advancement of Learning</i> (1605).&nbsp;
&ldquo;I do confess,&rdquo; he wrote to Sir Thomas Bodley,
&ldquo;since I was of any understanding, my mind hath in effect
been absent from that I have done.&rdquo; <a
name="citation281b"></a><a href="#footnote281b"
class="citation">[281b]</a>&nbsp; His mind was with his beloved
Reformation of Learning: this came between him and his legal, his
political labours, his pamphlet-writing, and his private schemes
and suits.&nbsp; To this burden of Atlas the Baconians add the
vamping-up of old plays for Shakespeare&rsquo;s company, and the
inditing of new plays, poems, and the Sonnets.&nbsp; Even without
this considerable addition to his tasks, Bacon is wonderful
enough, but with it&mdash;he needs the sturdy faith of the
Rationalist to accept him and his plot&mdash;to write plays under
the pseudonym of &ldquo;William Shakespeare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Talk of miracles as things which do not happen!&nbsp; The
activities of Bacon from 1591 to 1605; the strain on that
man&rsquo;s mind and heart,&mdash;especially his heart, when we
remember that he had to prosecute his passionately adored Essex
to the death; all this makes it seem, to me, improbable that, as
Mrs. Pott and her school of Baconians hold, he lived to be at
least a hundred and six, if not much older.&nbsp; No wonder that
he turned to <a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
282</span>tragedy, <i>Lear</i>, <i>Macbeth</i>, <i>Othello</i>,
and saw life <i>en noir</i>: man delighted him not, nor woman
either.</p>
<p>The occupations, and, even more, the scientific preoccupation
of Bacon, do not make his authorship of the plays a physical
impossibility.&nbsp; But they make it an intellectual
miracle.&nbsp; Perhaps I may be allowed to set off this marvel
against that other portent, Will Shakspere&rsquo;s knowledge and
frequent use of terms of Law. <a name="citation282a"></a><a
href="#footnote282a" class="citation">[282a]</a>&nbsp; I do not
pretend to understand how Will came to have them at the tip of
his pen.&nbsp; Thus it may be argued that the Sonnets are by
Bacon and no other man, because the Law is so familiar to the
author, and his legal terms are always used with so nice an
accuracy, that only Bacon can have been capable of these
mysterious productions.&nbsp; (But why was Bacon so wofully
inaccurate in points of scholarship and history?)</p>
<p>By precisely the same argument Lord Penzance proves that Bacon
(not Ben, as Mr. Greenwood holds) wrote for the players the
Dedication of the Folio. <a name="citation282b"></a><a
href="#footnote282b" class="citation">[282b]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;If
it should be the case that Francis Bacon wrote the plays, he
would, probably, afterwards have written the Dedication of the
Folio, and the style of it&rdquo; (stuffed with terms of law)
&ldquo;would be accounted for.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Greenwood thinks
that Jonson wrote the Dedication; so Ben, too, was fond of using
legal terms in literature.&nbsp; &ldquo;Legal terms abounded in
all plays <a name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
283</span>and poems of the period,&rdquo; says Sir Sidney Lee,
and Mr. Greenwood pounces on the word &ldquo;all.&rdquo; <a
name="citation283a"></a><a href="#footnote283a"
class="citation">[283a]</a>&nbsp; However he says, &ldquo;We must
admit that this use of legal jargon is frequently found in
lay-writers, poets, and others of the Elizabethan period&mdash;in
sonnets for example, where it seems to us
intolerable.&rdquo;&nbsp; Examples are given from Barnabe Barnes.
<a name="citation283b"></a><a href="#footnote283b"
class="citation">[283b]</a>&nbsp; The lawyers all agree, however,
that Shakespeare does the legal style &ldquo;more natural,&rdquo;
and more accurately than the rest.&nbsp; And yet I cannot even
argue that, if he did use legal terms at all, he would be sure to
do it pretty well.</p>
<p>For on this point of Will&rsquo;s use of legal phraseology I
frankly profess myself entirely at a loss.&nbsp; To use it in
poetry was part of the worse side of taste at that period.&nbsp;
The lawyers with one voice declare that Will&rsquo;s use of it is
copious and correct, and that their &ldquo;mystery&rdquo; is
difficult, their jargon hard to master; &ldquo;there is nothing
so dangerous,&rdquo; wrote Lord Campbell, &ldquo;as for one not
of the craft to tamper with our freemasonry.&rdquo;&nbsp; I have
not tampered with it.&nbsp; Perhaps a man of genius who found it
interesting might have learned the technical terms more readily
than lawyers deem possible.&nbsp; But Will, so accurate in his
legal terms, is so inaccurate on many other points; for example,
in civil and natural history, and in classic lore.&nbsp; Mr.
Greenwood proves him to be totally at sea as a naturalist.&nbsp;
On the habits of bees, for <a name="page284"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 284</span>example, &ldquo;his natural history
of the insect is as limited as it is inaccurate.&rdquo; <a
name="citation284a"></a><a href="#footnote284a"
class="citation">[284a]</a>&nbsp; Virgil, though not a Lord
Avebury, was a great entomologist, compared with Will.&nbsp;
About the cuckoo Will was recklessly misinformed.&nbsp; His
Natural History was folklore, or was taken from that great
medi&aelig;val storehouse of absurdities, the popular work of
Pliny.&nbsp; &ldquo;He went to contemporary error or antiquated
fancy for his facts, not to nature,&rdquo; says a critic quoted
by Mr. Greenwood. <a name="citation284b"></a><a
href="#footnote284b" class="citation">[284b]</a>&nbsp; Was that
worthy of Bacon?</p>
<p>All these charges against <i>le vieux Williams</i> (as
Th&eacute;ophile Gautier calls our Will) I admit.&nbsp; But Will
was no Bacon; Will had not &ldquo;taken all knowledge for his
province.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bacon, I hope, had not neglected
Bees!&nbsp; Thus the problem, why is Will accurate in his legal
terminology, and reckless of accuracy in quantity, in history, in
classic matters, is not by me to be solved.&nbsp; I can only
surmise that from curiosity, or for some other unknown reason, he
had read law-books, or drawn information from Templars about the
meaning of their jargon, and that, for once, he was technically
accurate.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>We have now passed in review the chief Baconian and
Anti-Willian arguments against Will Shakespeare&rsquo;s
authorship of the plays and <a name="page285"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 285</span>poems.&nbsp; Their chief argument
for Bacon is <i>aut Diabolus</i>, <i>aut Franciscus</i>, which,
freely interpreted, means, &ldquo;If Bacon is not the author, who
the devil is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We reply, that man is the author (in the main) to whom the
works are attributed by every voice of his own generation which
mentions them, namely, the only William Shakespeare that, from
1593 to the early years of the second decade of the following
century, held a prominent place in the world of the drama.&nbsp;
His authorship is explicitly vouched for by his fellow-players,
Heminge and Condell, to whom he left bequests in his will; and by
his sometime rival, later friend, and always critic, Ben Jonson;
Heywood, player and playwright and pamphleteer, who had been one
of Henslowe&rsquo;s &ldquo;hands,&rdquo; and lived into the Great
Rebellion, knew the stage and authors for the stage from within,
and <i>his</i> &ldquo;mellifluous Shakespeare&rdquo; is
&ldquo;Will,&rdquo; as his Beaumont was &ldquo;Frank,&rdquo; his
Marlowe &ldquo;Kit,&rdquo; his Fletcher,
&ldquo;Jack.&rdquo;&nbsp; The author of <i>Daiphantus</i> (1604),
mentioning the popularity of <i>Hamlet</i>, styles it &ldquo;one
of friendly Shakespeare&rsquo;s tragedies.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Shakespeare, to him, was our Will clearly, a man of known and
friendly character.&nbsp; The other authors of allusions did not
need to say <i>who</i> their &ldquo;Shakespeare&rdquo; was, any
more than they needed to say <i>who</i> Marlowe or any other poet
was.&nbsp; We have examined the possibly unprecedented argument
which demands that they who mention Shakespeare <a
name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 286</span>as the poet
must, if they would enlighten us, add explicitly that he is also
the actor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But all may have been deceived&rdquo; by the long
conspiracy of the astute Bacon, or the Nameless One.&nbsp; To
believe this possible, considering the eager and suspicious
jealousy and volubility of rival playwrights, is to be credulous
indeed.&nbsp; The Baconians, representing Will almost as
incapable of the use of pen and ink as &ldquo;the old hermit of
Prague,&rdquo; destroy their own case.&nbsp; A Will who had to
make his mark, like his father, could not pose as an author even
to the call-boy of his company.&nbsp; Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s
bookless Will, with some crumbs of Latin, and some power of
&ldquo;bumbasting out a blank verse,&rdquo; is a rather less
impossible pretender, indeed; but why and when did the speaker of
patois, the bookless one, write blank verse, from 1592 onwards,
and where are his blank verses?&nbsp; Where are the
&ldquo;works&rdquo; of Poet-Ape?&nbsp; As to the man, even Will
by tradition, whatever it may be worth, he was &ldquo;a handsome,
well-shaped man; very good company, and of a very ready and
pleasant, smooth wit.&rdquo;&nbsp; To his fellow-actors he was
&ldquo;so worthy a friend and fellow&rdquo; (associate).&nbsp; To
Jonson, &ldquo;he was, indeed, honest, and of an open and free
nature; had an excellent phantasy, brave notions, and gentle
expressions, wherein he flowed so freely that sometimes it was
necessary he should be stopped.&rdquo;&nbsp; If Jonson here
refers, as I suppose he does, to his conversation, it had that
extraordinary affluence <a name="page287"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 287</span>of thoughts, each mating itself with
as remarkable originality of richly figured expressions, which is
so characteristic of the style of Shakespeare&rsquo;s
plays.&nbsp; In this prodigality he was remote indeed from the
style of the Greeks; &ldquo;panting Time toils after him in
vain,&rdquo; and even the reader, much more the listener, might
say, <i>sufflaminandus est</i>; &ldquo;he needs to have the brake
put on.&rdquo; <a name="citation287a"></a><a href="#footnote287a"
class="citation">[287a]</a></p>
<p>Such, according to unimpeachable evidence, was Will.&nbsp;
Only despair can venture the sad suggestion that, under the name
of Shakespeare, Ben is here speaking of Bacon, as &ldquo;falling
into those things which could not escape laughter . . . which
were ridiculous.&rdquo;&nbsp; But to this last poor shift and
fantastic guess were the Anti-Willians and Baconians reduced.</p>
<p>Such was Shakespeare, according to a rival.</p>
<p>But it is &ldquo;impossible&rdquo; that a man should have
known so much, especially of classical literature and courtly
ways, and foreign manners and phrases, if he had no more, at
most, than four or five years at a Latin school, and five or six
years in that forcing-house of faculty, the London of the stage,
in the flush of the triumph over the Armada.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With innumerable sorts of English books and infinite
fardles of printed pamphlets this country is pestered, all shops
stuffed, and every <a name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
288</span>study furnished,&rdquo; says a contemporary. <a
name="citation288a"></a><a href="#footnote288a"
class="citation">[288a]</a>&nbsp; If a doubter will look at the
cheap and common books of that day (a play in quarto, and the
Sonnets of Shakespeare, when new, were sold for fippence) in any
great collection; he will not marvel that to a lover of books,
poor as he might be, many were accessible.&nbsp; Such a man
cannot be kept from books.</p>
<p>If the reader will look into &ldquo;the translations and
imitations of the classics which poured from the press . . . the
poems and love-pamphlets and plays of the University wits&rdquo;
(when these chanced to be printed), &ldquo;the tracts and
dialogues in the prevailing taste,&rdquo; <a
name="citation288b"></a><a href="#footnote288b"
class="citation">[288b]</a> he will understand the literary soil
in which the genius of Shakespeare blossomed as rapidly as the
flowers in &ldquo;Adonis&rsquo; garden.&rdquo;&nbsp; The whole
literature was, to an extent which we find tedious, saturated
with classical myths, anecdotes, philosophic <i>dicta</i>&mdash;a
world of knowledge of a kind then &ldquo;in widest commonalty
spread,&rdquo; but now so much forgotten that, to Baconians and
the public, such lore seems recondite learning.</p>
<p>The gallants who haunted the stage, and such University wits
as could get the money, or had talent (like Crichton) to
&ldquo;dispute their way through Europe,&rdquo; made the Italian
tour, and, notoriously, were &ldquo;Italianate.&rdquo;&nbsp; They
would not be chary of reminiscences of Florence, Venice, and <a
name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 289</span>Rome.&nbsp;
Actors visited Denmark and Germany.&nbsp; No man at home was far
to seek for knowledge of Elsinore, the mysterious Venetian
&ldquo;tranect or common ferry,&rdquo; the gondolas, and the
Rialto.&nbsp; There was no lack of soldiers fresh and voluble
from the foreign wars.&nbsp; Only dullards, or the unthinking,
can be surprised by the ease with which a quick-witted man,
having some knowledge of Latin, can learn to read a novel in
French, Italian, or Spanish.&nbsp; That Shakespeare was the very
reverse of a dullard, of the clod of Baconian fancy, is proved by
the fact that he was thought capable of his works.&nbsp; For
courtly manners he had the literary convention and Lyly&rsquo;s
Court Comedies, with what he saw when playing at the Court and in
the houses of the great.&nbsp; As to untaught nobility of
manners, there came to the Court of France in 1429, from a small
pig-breeding village on the marches of Lorraine, one whose
manners were deemed of exquisite grace, propriety, and charm, by
all who saw and heard her: of her manners and swift wit and
repartee, the official record of her trial bears concordant
evidence.&nbsp; Other untaught gifts she possessed, and the
historic record is unimpeached as regards that child of genius,
Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ne me dites jamais cette b&ecirc;te de mot</i>,
<i>impossible</i>,&rdquo; said Napoleon: it is indeed a stupid
word where genius is concerned.</p>
<p>If intellectual &ldquo;miracles&rdquo; were impossible to
genius, even Bacon could not have been and <a
name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 290</span>done all
that he was and did, and also the author of the Shakespearean
plays and poems; even Ben could not have been the scholar that he
was.&nbsp; For the rest, I need not return on my tracks and
explain once more such shallow mysteries as the &ldquo;Silence of
Philip Henslowe,&rdquo; and the lack of literary anecdotage about
Shakespeare in a stupendously illiterate country town.&nbsp; Had
Will, not Ben, visited Drummond of Hawthornden, we should have
matter enough of the kind desired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have the epics of Homer,&rdquo; people say,
&ldquo;what matters it whether they be by a Man, or by a
Syndicate that was in business through seven centuries?&nbsp; We
have the plays of Shakespeare, what matters it whether he, or
Bacon, or X. were, in the main, the author?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It matters to us, if we hold such doubts to be fantastic
pedantries, such guesses contrary to the nature of things; while
we wish to give love and praise and gratitude where they are due;
to that Ach&aelig;an &ldquo;Father of the rest&rdquo;; and to
&ldquo;friendly Shakespeare.&rdquo;</p>

293</span>APPENDIX I<br />
<span class="GutSmall">&ldquo;TROILUS AND
CRESSIDA&rdquo;</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">To</span> myself <i>Troilus and
Cressida</i> is, with <i>Henry VI</i>, Part I, the most
mysterious among the Shakespearean plays.&nbsp; Here we find, if
Will wrote it, or had any hand in it, the greatest poet of the
modern world in touch with the heroes of the greatest poet of the
ancient world; but the English author&rsquo;s eyes are dimmed by
the mists and dust of post-Homeric perversions of the Tale of
Troy.&nbsp; The work of perversion began, we know, in the eighth
century before our era, when, by the author of the <i>Cypria</i>,
these favourite heroes of Homer, Odysseus and Diomede, were
represented as scoundrels, assassins, and cowards.</p>
<p>In the Prologue to the play (whosoever wrote it) we see that
the writer is no scholar.&nbsp; He makes the Ach&aelig;an fleet
muster in &ldquo;the port of <i>Athens</i>,&rdquo; of all
places.&nbsp; Even Ovid gave the Homeric trysting-place, Aulis,
in B&oelig;otia.&nbsp; (This Prologue is not in the Folio of
1623.)&nbsp; Six gates hath the Englishman&rsquo;s Troy, and the
Sc&aelig;an is not one of them.</p>
<p>The loves of Troilus and Cressida, with Pandarus as
go-between, are from the medi&aelig;val Troy books, and were
wholly unknown to Homer, whose Pandarus is only notable for
loosing a <a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
294</span>traitor&rsquo;s shaft at Menelaus, in time of truce,
and for his death at the hand of Diomede.&nbsp; The play begins
after the duel (Iliad, III) between Paris and Menelaus: in the
play, not in Homer, Paris &ldquo;retires hurt,&rdquo; as is at
first reported.&nbsp; Hector has a special grudge against the
Telamonian Aias.&nbsp; As in the Iliad there is a view of the
Ach&aelig;ans, taken from the walls by Priam and Helen; so, in
the play, Pandarus and Cressida review the Trojans re-entering
the city.&nbsp; Paris turns out not to be hurt after all.</p>
<p>In Act i. Scene 3, the Ach&aelig;ans hold council, and regret
the disaffection of Achilles.&nbsp; Here comes Ulysses&rsquo;
great speech on discipline, in armies, and in states, the
gradations of rank and duty; commonly thought to be a leaf in
Shakespeare&rsquo;s crown of bays.&nbsp; The speeches of
Agamemnon and Nestor are dignified; indeed the poet treats
Agamemnon much more kindly than Homer is wont to do.&nbsp; But
the poet represents Achilles as laughing in his quarters at
Patroclus&rsquo;s imitation of the cough and other infirmities of
old Nestor, to which Homer, naturally, never alludes.&nbsp;
Throughout, the English poet regards Achilles with the eyes of
his most infamous late Greek and ignorant medi&aelig;val
detractors.&nbsp; The Homeric sequence of events is so far
preserved that, on the day of the duel between Paris and
Menelaus, comes (through &AElig;neas) the challenge by Hector to
fight any Greek in &ldquo;gentle and joyous passage of
arms&rdquo; (Iliad, VII).&nbsp; As in the Iliad, the Greeks
decide by lot who is to oppose Hector; but by the contrivance of
Odysseus <a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
295</span>(not by chance, as in Homer) the lot falls on
Aias.&nbsp; In the Iliad Aias is as strong and sympathetic as
Porthos in <i>Les Trois Mousquetaires</i>.&nbsp; The play makes
him as great an eater of beef, and as stupid as Sir Andrew
Aguecheek.&nbsp; Achilles, save in a passage quite out of accord
with the rest of the piece, is nearly as dull as Aias, is
discourteous, and is cowardly!&nbsp; No poet and no scholar who
knew Homer&rsquo;s heroes in Homer&rsquo;s Greek, could thus
degrade them; and the whole of the revilings of Thersites are
loathsome in their profusion of filthy thoughts.&nbsp; It does
not follow that Will did not write the part of Thersites.&nbsp;
Some of the most beautiful and Shakespearean pieces of verse
adorn the play; one would say that no man but Will could have
written them.&nbsp; Troilus and Cressida, at first, appear
&ldquo;to dally with the innocence of love&rdquo;; and nothing
can be nobler and more dramatic than the lines in which Cressida,
compelled to go to her father, Calchas, in the Greek camp, in
exchange for Antenor, professes her loyalty in love.&nbsp; But
the Homeric and the alien later elements,&mdash;the story of
false love,&mdash;cannot be successfully combined.&nbsp; The
poet, whoever he was, appears to weary and to break down.&nbsp;
He ends, indeed, as the Iliad ends, with the death of Hector, but
Hector, in the play, is murdered, while resting unarmed, without
shield and helmet, after stripping a suit of sumptuous mail from
a nameless runaway.&nbsp; In the play he has slain Patroclus, but
has not stripped him of the armour of Achilles, which, in Homer,
he is wearing.&nbsp; Achilles then meets Hector, but far from
rushing <a name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
296</span>to avenge on him Patroclus, he retires like a coward,
musters his men, and makes them surround and slay the defenceless
Hector.</p>
<p>Cressida, who is sent to her father Calchas, in the Greek
camp, in a day becomes &ldquo;the sluttish spoil of
opportunity,&rdquo; and of Diomede, and the comedy praised by the
preface-writer of a quarto of 1609, is a squalid tragedy reeking
of Thersites and Pandarus, of a light o&rsquo; love, and the base
victory of cruel cowardice over knightly Hector.&nbsp; Yet there
seemed to be muffled notes from the music, and broken lights from
the splendour of Homer.&nbsp; When Achilles eyes Hector all over,
during a truce, and insultingly says that he is thinking in what
part of his body he shall drive the spear, we are reminded of
Iliad, XXII, 320&ndash;326, where Achilles searches his own
armour, worn by Patroclus, stripped by Hector from him, and worn
by Hector, for a chink in the mail.&nbsp; Yet, after all, these
points are taken, not from the Iliad, but from Caxton&rsquo;s
popular Troy Book.</p>
<p>Once more, when Hector is dead, and Achilles bids his men
to</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;cry amain,<br />
Achilles hath the mighty Hector slain,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>we think of Iliad, XXII, 390&ndash;393, where Achilles
commands the Myrmidons to go singing the p&aelig;an</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Glory have we won, we have slain great
Hector!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sumptuous armour stripped by Hector from a nameless man,
recalls his winning of the arms of Achilles from Patroclus.&nbsp;
But, in fact, this passage is also borrowed, with the murder <a
name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 297</span>of Hector,
from Caxton, except as regards the p&aelig;an.</p>
<p>It may be worth noting that Chapman&rsquo;s first instalment
of his translation of the Iliad, containing Books I, II, and
VII&ndash;XI, appeared in 1598, and thence the author could adapt
the passages from Iliad, Book VII.&nbsp; In or about 1598&ndash;9
occurred, in <i>Histriomastix</i>, by Marston and others, a
burlesque speech in which Troilus, addressing Cressida, speaks of
&ldquo;thy knight,&rdquo; who &ldquo;<i>Shakes</i> his furious
<i>Speare</i>,&rdquo; while in April 1599, Henslowe&rsquo;s
account-book contains entries of money paid to Dekker and Chettle
for a play on Troilus and Cressida, for the Earl of
Nottingham&rsquo;s Company. <a name="citation297a"></a><a
href="#footnote297a" class="citation">[297a]</a>&nbsp; Of this
play no more is known, nor can we be sure that Chapman&rsquo;s
seven Books of the Iliad (I, II, VII&ndash;XI) of 1598 attracted
the attention of playwrights, from Shakespeare to Chettle and
Dekker, to Trojan affairs.&nbsp; The coincidences at least are
curious.&nbsp; If &ldquo;<i>Shakes</i> his furious
<i>Speare</i>&rdquo; in <i>Histriomastix</i> refers to
Shakespeare in connection with Cressida, while, in 1599, Dekker
and Chettle were doing a <i>Troilus and Cressida</i> for a
company not Shakespeare&rsquo;s, then there were <i>two Troilus
and Cressida</i> in the field.&nbsp; A licence to print a
<i>Troilus and Cressida</i> was obtained in 1602&ndash;3, but the
quarto of our play, the Shakespearean play, is of 1609, &ldquo;as
it is acted by my Lord Chamberlain&rsquo;s men,&rdquo; that is,
by Shakespeare&rsquo;s Company.&nbsp; Now Dekker and Chettle
wrote, apparently, for Lord Nottingham&rsquo;s Company.&nbsp; One
quarto of 1609 declares, in a Preface, <a
name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 298</span>that the
play has &ldquo;never been staled with the stage&rdquo;; another
edition of the same year, from the same publishers, has not the
Preface, but declares that the piece &ldquo;was acted by the
King&rsquo;s Majesty&rsquo;s servants <i>at the Globe</i>.&rdquo;
<a name="citation298a"></a><a href="#footnote298a"
class="citation">[298a]</a>&nbsp; The author of the Preface (Ben
Jonson, Mr. Greenwood thinks, <a name="citation298b"></a><a
href="#footnote298b" class="citation">[298b]</a>) speaks only of
a single author, who has written other admirable comedies.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When he is gone, and his comedies out of sale, you will
scramble for them, and set up a new English
Inquisition.&rdquo;&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; The whole affair is a
puzzle.&nbsp; But if the author of the Preface is right about the
single author of <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>, and if Shakespeare
is alluded to in connection with Cressida, in
<i>Histriomastix</i> (1599), then it appears to me that
Shakespeare, in 1598&ndash;9, after Chapman&rsquo;s portion of
the Iliad appeared, was author of one <i>Troilus and
Cressida</i>, extant in 1602&ndash;3 (when its publication was
barred till the publisher &ldquo;got authority&rdquo;), while
Chettle and Dekker, in April 1599, were busy with another
<i>Troilus and Cressida</i>, as why should they not be?&nbsp; In
an age so lax about copyright, if their play was of their own
original making, are we to suppose that there was copyright in
the names of the leading persons of the piece, Troilus and
Cressida?</p>

<p>Perhaps not: but meanwhile Mr. Greenwood cites Judge
Stotsenburg&rsquo;s opinion <a name="citation298c"></a><a
href="#footnote298c" class="citation">[298c]</a> that
Henslowe&rsquo;s entries of April 1599 &ldquo;refute the
Shakespearean claim to the authorship of <i>Troilus and
Cressida</i>,&rdquo; which exhibits &ldquo;the collaboration <a
name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 299</span>of two
men,&rdquo; as &ldquo;leading commentators&rdquo; hold that it
does.&nbsp; But the learned Judge mentions as a conceivable
alternative that &ldquo;there were two plays on the subject with
the same name,&rdquo; and, really, it looks as if there
were!&nbsp; The Judge does not agree &ldquo;with Webb and other
gifted writers that Bacon wrote this play.&rdquo;&nbsp; So far
the Court is quite with him.&nbsp; He goes on however, &ldquo;It
was, in my opinion, based on the foregoing facts, originally the
production of Dekker and Chettle, added to and philosophically
dressed by Francis Bacon.&rdquo;&nbsp; But, according to Mr.
Greenwood, &ldquo;it is admitted not only that the different
writing of two authors is apparent in the Folio play, but also
that &lsquo;Shakespeare&rsquo; must have had at least some share
in a play of <i>Troilus and Cressida</i> as early as the very
year 1599, in the spring of which Dekker and Chettle are found
engaged in writing their play of that name,&rdquo; on the
evidence of <i>Histriomastix</i>. <a name="citation299a"></a><a
href="#footnote299a" class="citation">[299a]</a>&nbsp; How that
evidence proves that &ldquo;a play of <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>
had been <i>published</i> as by &lsquo;Shakespeare&rsquo; about
1599,&rdquo; I know not.&nbsp; Perhaps &ldquo;published&rdquo;
means &ldquo;acted&rdquo;?&nbsp; &ldquo;And it is not
unreasonable to suppose that this play&rdquo; (&ldquo;published
as by Shakespeare&rdquo;) &ldquo;was the one to which Henslowe
alludes&rdquo;&mdash;as being written in April 1599, by Dekker
and Chettle.</p>
<p>If so, the play must show the hands of three, not two, men,
Dekker, Chettle, and &ldquo;Shakespeare,&rdquo; the Great
Unknown, or Bacon.&nbsp; He collaborates with Dekker and Chettle,
in a play <a name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
300</span>for Lord Nottingham&rsquo;s men (according to Sir
Sidney Lee), <a name="citation300a"></a><a href="#footnote300a"
class="citation">[300a]</a> but it is, later at least, played by
Shakespeare&rsquo;s company; and perhaps Bacon gets none of the
&pound;4 paid <a name="citation300b"></a><a href="#footnote300b"
class="citation">[300b]</a> to Dekker and Chettle.&nbsp; Henslowe
does not record his sale of the Dekker and Chettle play to
Shakespeare&rsquo;s or to any company or purchaser.&nbsp; Without
an entry of the careful Henslowe recording his receipts for the
sale of the Dekker and Chettle play to any purchaser, it is not
easy to see how Shakespeare&rsquo;s company procured the
manuscript, and thus enabled him to refashion it.&nbsp; Perhaps
no reader will fail to recognise his hand in the beautiful blank
verse of many passages.&nbsp; I am not familiar enough with the
works of Dekker and Chettle to assign to them the less desirable
passages.&nbsp; Thersites is beastly: a Yahoo of Swift&rsquo;s
might poison with such phrases as his the name and nature of
love, loyalty, and military courage.&nbsp; But whatsoever
Shakespeare did, he did thoroughly, and if he were weary, if man
delighted him not, nor woman either, he may have written the
whole piece, in which love perishes for the whim of &ldquo;a
daughter of the game,&rdquo; and the knightly Hector is butchered
to sate the vanity of his cowardly Achilles.&nbsp; If Shakespeare
read the books translated by Chapman, he must have read them in
the same spirit as Keats, and was likely to find that the poetry
of the Ach&aelig;an could not be combined with the Ionian,
Athenian, and Roman perversions, as he <a
name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 301</span>knew them
in the medi&aelig;val books of Troy, in the English of Lydgate
and Caxton.&nbsp; The chivalrous example of Chaucer he did not
follow.&nbsp; Probably Will looked on the play as one of his
failures.&nbsp; The Editor, if we can speak of an Editor, of the
Folio clearly thrust the play in late, so confusedly that it is
not paged, and is not mentioned in the table of the contents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Grand Possessors&rdquo; of the play referred to in
the Preface to one of the two quartos of 1609 we may suppose to
be Shakespeare&rsquo;s Company.&nbsp; In this case the owners
would not permit the publication of the play if they could
prevent it.&nbsp; The title provokes Mr. Greenwood to say,
&ldquo;Why these worthies should be so styled is not apparent;
indeed the supposition seems not a little ridiculous.&rdquo; <a
name="citation301a"></a><a href="#footnote301a"
class="citation">[301a]</a>&nbsp; Of course, if the players were
the possessors, &ldquo;grand&rdquo; is merely a jeer, by a person
advertising a successful piracy.&nbsp; And in regard to
Tieck&rsquo;s conjecture that James I is alluded to as &ldquo;the
grand possessor, for whom the play was expressly written,&rdquo;
<a name="citation301b"></a><a href="#footnote301b"
class="citation">[301b]</a> the autocratic James was very capable
of protecting himself against larcenous publishers.</p>

302</span>APPENDIX II<br />
<span class="GutSmall">CHETTLE&rsquo;S SUPPOSED ALLUSION TO WILL
SHAKSPERE</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> discussing contemporary
allusions to William Shakspere or Shakespeare (or however you
spell the name), I have not relied on Chettle&rsquo;s remarks (in
<i>Kind-Hart&rsquo;s Dreame</i>, 1592) concerning Greene&rsquo;s
<i>Groatsworth of Wit</i>.&nbsp; Chettle speaks of it, saying,
&ldquo;in which a letter, written to divers play-makers, is
offensively by one or two of them taken.&rdquo;&nbsp; It appears
that by &ldquo;one or two&rdquo; Chettle means <i>two</i>.&nbsp;
&ldquo;With <i>neither</i> of them that take offence was I
acquainted&rdquo; (at the time when he edited the
<i>Groatsworth</i>), &ldquo;and with one of them I care not if I
never be.&rdquo;&nbsp; We do not know who &ldquo;the Gentlemen
his Quondam acquaintance,&rdquo; addressed by Greene, were.&nbsp;
They are usually supposed to have been Marlowe, Peele, and Lodge,
or Nash.&nbsp; We do not know which of the two who take offence
is the man with whom Chettle did not care to be acquainted.&nbsp;
Of &ldquo;the other,&rdquo; according to Chettle, &ldquo;myself
have seen his demeanour no less civil than he is excellent in the
quality he professes&rdquo; (that is, &ldquo;in his
profession,&rdquo; as we say), &ldquo;besides divers of worship
have reported his uprightness of dealing, which <a
name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 303</span>argues his
honesty; and his facetious grace in writing that approves his
art.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking from his own observation, Chettle avers that the
person of whom he speaks is civil in his demeanour, and
(<i>apparently</i>) that he is &ldquo;excellent in the quality he
professes&rdquo;&mdash;in his profession.&nbsp; Speaking on the
evidence of &ldquo;divers of worship,&rdquo; the same man is said
to possess &ldquo;facetious grace in writing.&rdquo;&nbsp; Had
his writings been then published, Chettle, a bookish man, would
have read them and formed his own opinion.&nbsp; Works of Lodge,
Peele, and Marlowe had been published.&nbsp; Writing is
<i>not</i> &ldquo;the quality he professes,&rdquo; is not the
&ldquo;profession&rdquo; of the man to whom Chettle refers.&nbsp;
On the other hand, the profession of Greene&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Quondam acquaintance&rdquo; <i>was</i> writing,
&ldquo;they spend their wits in making Plays.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus
the man who wrote, but whose profession was not that of writing,
does not, so far, appear to have been one of those addressed by
Greene.&nbsp; It seems undeniable that Greene addresses gentlemen
who are &ldquo;playmakers,&rdquo; who &ldquo;spend their wits in
making Plays,&rdquo; and who are <i>not</i> actors; for
Greene&rsquo;s purpose is to warn them against the rich,
ungrateful actors.&nbsp; If Greene&rsquo;s friends, at the moment
when he wrote, were, or if any one of them then was, by
profession an actor, Greene&rsquo;s warning to him against
actors, directed to an actor, is not, to me, intelligible.&nbsp;
But Mr. Greenwood writes, &ldquo;As I have shown, George Peele
was one of the playwrights addressed by Greene, and Peele was a
successful player as well as <a name="page304"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 304</span>playwright, and might quite truly
have been alluded to both as having &lsquo;facetious grace in
writing,&rsquo; and being &lsquo;excellent in the quality he
professed,&rsquo; that is, as a professional actor.&rdquo; <a
name="citation304a"></a><a href="#footnote304a"
class="citation">[304a]</a></p>
<p>I confess that I did not know that George Peele, M.A., of
Oxford, had ever been a player, and a successful player.&nbsp;
But one may ask,&mdash;in 1592 did George Peele &ldquo;profess
the quality&rdquo; of an actor; was he then a professional actor,
and only an occasional playwright?&nbsp; If so, I am not apt to
believe that Greene seriously advised him not to put faith in the
members of his own profession.&nbsp; From them, as a successful
member of their profession (a profession which, as Greene
complains, &ldquo;exploited&rdquo; dramatic authors), Peele stood
in no danger.&nbsp; Thus I do not see how Chettle&rsquo;s
professional actor, reported to have facetious grace in writing,
can be identified with Peele.&nbsp; The identification seems to
me impossible.&nbsp; Peele and Marlowe, in 1592, were literary
gentlemen; Lodge, in 1592, was filibustering, though a literary
man; he had not yet become a physician.&nbsp; In 1592, none of
the three had any profession but that of literature, so far as I
am aware.&nbsp; The man who had a special profession, and also
wrote, was not one of these three; nor was he Tom Nash, a mere
literary gentleman, pamphleteer and playwright.</p>
<p>I do not know the name of any one of the three to whom Greene
addressed the <i>Groatsworth</i>, though the atheistic writer of
tragedies seems meant, and disgracefully meant, for
Marlowe.&nbsp; <a name="page305"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
305</span>I only know that Chettle is expressing his regrets for
Greene&rsquo;s language to some one whom he applauded as to his
exercise of his profession; and who, according to &ldquo;divers
of worship,&rdquo; had also &ldquo;facetious grace in
writing.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Myself have seen him no less civil
than he is excellent in the quality he professes&rdquo;; whether
or not this means that Chettle has <i>seen</i> his excellence in
his profession, I cannot tell for certain; but Chettle&rsquo;s
remark is, at least, contrasted with what he gives merely from
report&mdash;&ldquo;the facetious grace in writing&rdquo; of the
man in question.&nbsp; <i>His</i> writing is not part of his
profession, so he is not, in 1592 (I conceive), Lodge, Peele,
Marlowe, or Nash.</p>
<p>Who, then, is this mysterious personage?&nbsp; Malone, Dyce,
Steevens, Collier, Halliwell-Phillipps, Knight, Sir Sidney Lee,
Messrs. Gosse and Garnett, and Mr. J. C. Collins say that he is
Will Shakspere.&nbsp; But Mr. Fleay and Mr. Castle, whose
&ldquo;mind&rdquo; is &ldquo;legal,&rdquo; have pointed out that
this weird being cannot be Shake-scene (or Shakspere, if Greene
meant Shakspere), attacked by Greene.&nbsp; For Chettle says that
in the <i>Groatsworth of Wit</i> &ldquo;a letter, written to
divers play-makers, is offensively by one or two of them
taken.&rdquo;&nbsp; The mysterious one is, therefore, one of the
playwrights addressed by Greene.&nbsp; Consequently all the
followers of Malone, who wrote before Messrs. Fleay and Castle,
are mistaken; and what Mr. Greenwood has to say about Sir Sidney
Lee, J. C. Collins, and Dr. Garnett, and Mr. Gosse, in the way of
moral reprobation, may be read by the curious in his pages. <a
name="citation305a"></a><a href="#footnote305a"
class="citation">[305a]</a></p>
<p><a name="page306"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
306</span>Meanwhile, if we take Chettle to have been a strict
grammarian, by his words&mdash;&ldquo;a letter, written to divers
play-makers, is offensively by one or two of them taken,&rdquo;
Will is excluded; the letter was most assuredly not written to
<i>him</i>.&nbsp; But I, whose mind is not legal, am not certain
that Chettle does not mean that the letter, written to divers
play-makers, was by one or two makers of plays offensively
taken.</p>
<p>This opinion seems the less improbable, as the person to whom
Chettle is most apologetic excels in a quality or profession,
which is contrasted with, and is not identical with, &ldquo;his
facetious grace in writing&rdquo;&mdash;a <i>parergon</i>, or
&ldquo; bye-work,&rdquo; in his case.&nbsp; Whoever this person
was, he certainly was not Marlowe, Peele, Lodge, or Nash.&nbsp;
We must look for some other person who had a profession, and also
was reported to have facetious grace in writing.</p>
<p>If Chettle is to be held tight to grammar, Greene referred to
some one unknown, some one who wrote for the stage, but had
another profession.&nbsp; If Chettle is not to be thus tautly
construed, I confess that to myself he seems to have had
Shakspere, even Will, in his mind.&nbsp; For Will in 1592 had
&ldquo;a quality which he professed,&rdquo; that of an actor; and
also (I conceive) was reported to have &ldquo; facetious grace in
writing.&rdquo;&nbsp; But other gentlemen may have combined these
attributes; wherefore I lay no stress on the statements of
Chettle, as if they referred to our Will Shakspere.</p>

(<i>Cornhill Magazine</i>, November 1911) he makes such reply as
the space permits to a paper of my own, &ldquo;Shakespeare or
X?&rdquo; in the September number.&nbsp; With my goodwill he
might have written thirty-two pages to my sixteen, but I am not
the Editor, and never heard of Mr. Greenwood&rsquo;s note till
May 1912.</p>
<p>He says that I had represented him as stating that the Unknown
genius adopted the name of William Shake-speare or Shakespeare
&ldquo;as a good <i>nom de guerre</i>, without any reference to
the fact that there was an actor in existence of the name of
William Shakspere, whose name was sometimes written Shakespeare,
and without the least idea that the works he published under this
pseudonym would be fathered upon the actor . . . &rdquo; (My
meaning has obviously been too obscurely stated by me.)</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood next writes that the confusion between the
actor, and the unknown taking the name William Shakespeare,
&ldquo;did happen and was intended to happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>C&rsquo;est l&agrave; le miracle</i>!</p>
<p>How could it happen if the actor were the bookless, ignorant
man whom Mr. Greenwood describes?&nbsp; It could not happen: Will
must have been unmasked in a day.&nbsp; The fact that a strange
plot existed was only too obvious.&nbsp; The Unknown&rsquo;s
secret must have been tracked by the hounds of keenest nose in
the packs of rival and jealous authors and of actors.&nbsp; None
gives tongue.</p>

Shakspere the Stratford player.&rdquo;&nbsp; That position I

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
